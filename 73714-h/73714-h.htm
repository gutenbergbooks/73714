</div>

<p>In planning for this series of reprints of Early Western
Travels, we were confronted by an embarrassment of
riches. To reissue all of the many excellent works of
travel originally published during the formative period
of Western settlement, would obviously be impossible.
A selection had therefore to be made, both as to period
and material. The century commencing with Conrad
Weiser’s notable journey to the Western Indians in 1748,
set convenient limits to the field in the matter of time.
The question of material was much more difficult.</p>

<p>It being unlikely that any two editors would choose the
same volumes for reprint, criticism of our list will undoubtedly
be made. It should, however, candidly be explained
that the matter of selection has in each case necessarily
been affected by two important considerations—(1) the
intrinsic value of the original from the historical side, and
(2) its present rarity and market value. The Editor
having selected a list of items worthy of a new lease of
life, the Publishers, from their intimate knowledge of the
commercial aspect of rare Americana, advised which of
these in their opinion were sufficiently in demand by
libraries and collectors to render the enterprise financially
productive. It is believed that this co-operative method
has resulted in an interesting collection, and given point
to the descriptive sub-title: “Some of the best and
rarest contemporary volumes of travel ... in the Middle
and Far West, during the period of early American
settlement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>The first volume of our series is necessarily more varied
in composition than any of its successors, it having been
deemed important to present herein several typical early
tours into the Indian country west of the Alleghenies.</p>

<p>That of Conrad Weiser, occurring in August and
September of 1748, was the first official journey undertaken
at the instance of the English colonies, to the
west of the mountain wall. His purpose was, to carry to
the tribesmen on the Ohio a present from the Pennsylvania
and Virginia authorities. The results were favorable
to an English alliance, but they were partially
neutralized by the French expedition headed by Céloron
the following year.</p>

<p>The journals of George Croghan (1750-65) are an
epitome of the Indian history of the time. The first
three documents deal with the period of English progress—in
1750, Croghan was on the Ohio en route to the Shawnee
towns and Pickawillany; the next season, he outwitted
Joncaire on the Allegheny. The four succeeding documents
are concerned with the period of hostility to the
English—in 1754 he was on the Ohio after Washington
had passed (December, 1753); the letter from Aughwick,
in 1755, tells of affairs after Braddock’s defeat; in 1756,
we learn particulars of Indian affairs; and in 1757 is
given a résumé of past events. The last two journals are
the longest and most important—that of 1760-61 is concerned,
topographically and otherwise, with the trip to
Detroit via Lake Erie, in the company of Rogers’s Rangers,
and the return by land to Pittsburg; that of 1765, with a
tour down the Ohio towards the Illinois, where the writer
is captured and carried to Ouiatanon—in due course
making a peace with Pontiac, and returning to Niagara.</p>

<p>The journals of Christian Frederick Post and Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Morris are interludes, as to time, in the Croghan diaries.
Post’s two journals cover the months of July to September,
1758, and October, 1758 to January, 1759. He
was at first sent out, by the northern trail, in midsummer,
as an official messenger to the hostiles, among whom he
succeeded in securing a kind of neutrality—a venturesome
expedition into the neighborhood of Fort Duquesne,
whose French commandant offered a price upon his head.
The second journey, in the autumn, was undertaken to
carry the news of the treaty of Easton (October, 1758),
and pave the way for General Forbes’s advance. In the
course of his journey he proceeded to the Indian towns
on the Ohio and its northern tributaries, and returned
to the settlements with Forbes’s army.</p>

<p>Captain Morris accompanied Bradstreet (1764) on the
latter’s expedition towards Detroit. Being dispatched
from Cedar Point on a mission to the French in the
Illinois, Morris was arrested and maltreated at the
Ottawa village at Maumee Rapids. He saw Pontiac,
went to Fort Miami, narrowly escaped being burned at
the stake, and finally made his escape through the woods
to Detroit. His journal presents a thrilling episode in
Western history.</p>

<p>It is our purpose, in these reprints, accurately to republish
the original volumes, with all of their illustrations
and other features. While seeking to reproduce the old
text as closely as practicable, with its typographic and
orthographic peculiarities, it has been found advisable
here and there to make a few minor changes; these consist
almost wholly of palpable blemishes, the result of negligent
proof-reading—such as turned letters, transposed
letters, slipped letters, and mis-spacings. Such corrections
will be made without specific mention; in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
instances, however, the original error has for a reason been
retained, and in juxtaposition the correction given within
brackets. We indicate, throughout, the pagination of
the old edition which we are reprinting, by inclosing
within brackets the number of each page at its beginning,
<i>e. g.</i> [24]; in the few instances where pages were, as the
fruit of carelessness in make-up, misnumbered in the
original, we have given the incorrect as well as the correct
figure, <i>e. g.</i> [25, <i>i. e.</i> 125]. In two or three instances,
where matter foreign to our purpose was introduced in
the volume as originally published—such as the journal
of a voyage not within our field, or an appendix of irrelevant
or unimportant matter—we have taken the liberty
of eliminating this; in such cases, however, especial attention
will be called to the omission.</p>

<p>An analytical index to the series will appear in the
concluding volume.</p>

<p>In the preparation of notes for the present volume,
the Editor has been assisted by Louise Phelps Kellogg,
Ph.D., of the Division of Maps and Manuscripts in the
Wisconsin State Historical Library. He has also been
favored with valuable information on various points, from
Colonel Reuben T. Durrett of Louisville, Mr. Frank H.
Severance of Buffalo, the Western Reserve Historical Society
at Cleveland, and Dr. Ernest C. Richardson and
Dr. John Rogers Williams of Princeton University.</p>

</div>

<p>Conrad Weiser, one of the most prominent agents in
the management of Indian affairs during the later French
wars, was a native of Würtemberg, being born November
2, 1696. When Conrad was but fourteen years old, his
father, John Conrad Weiser, led a party of Palatines to
America where they lived four years on the Livingston
manor in New York, and in 1714 removed to Schoharie.
There young Weiser came in close contact with the
Mohawk Indians, was adopted into their tribe, and living
among them for some years became master of their
language.</p>

<p>In 1729, he and his family, consisting of a wife and five
young children, removed to Berks (then Lancaster)
County, Pennsylvania, where a number of Weiser’s
countrymen had preceded them. The new homestead
was a mile east of the present town of Womelsdorf, and
became the centre of an extended hospitality both for
Pennsylvania Germans and visiting Indians. When
Reading was laid out (1748), Weiser was one of the commissioners
for that purpose, building therein a house and
store that are still standing.</p>

<p>His first employment as an interpreter was in 1731,
when forty shillings were allotted him for his services.
From this time forward he was official interpreter for
Pennsylvania, and for thirty years was employed in every
important Indian transaction. The Pennsylvania Council
testified in 1736 “that they had found Conrad faithfull
and honest, that he is a true good Man &amp; had Spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
their words [the Indians’] &amp; our Words, and not his
own.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Again in 1743, the governor of Virginia requested
the province of Pennsylvania to send their “honest interpreter,”
Conrad Weiser, to adjust a difficulty with the
Iroquois Indians; whereupon he proceeded to Onondaga
with a present of £100 on the part of Virginia, and made
peace for the English colonists.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The following year,
Weiser was chief interpreter at the important treaty of
Lancaster; and throughout King George’s War was
occupied with negotiations with the Six Nations, detaching
them from the French influence, and keeping
the Pennsylvania Delawares quiet “upon their
mats.”</p>

<p>After the journey to the Ohio, described in the following
diary, Weiser’s Indian transactions were largely confined
to the province of Pennsylvania; Montour and
Croghan taking over the business with the Ohio Indians
until the outbreak of the French and Indian War. Weiser
now assumed duties in a military capacity. He raised
a company of soldiers for the Canadian expedition
(1755), and later was made lieutenant-colonel, with the
care of the frontier forts under his charge. At the same
time the New York authorities besought his influence
with the Mohawks and Western Iroquois; and he assisted
in arranging the treaty at Easton, which prepared the
way for the success of Forbes’s expedition (1758).</p>

<p>Weiser was the most influential German of his section,
possibly of all Pennsylvania; but his religious affiliations
and enmities interfered with his political ambitions.
Originally a Lutheran, in 1735 he became concerned
with the movement of the Seventh Day Baptists, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
led to the establishment of the community at Ephrata,
where he was known as Brother Enoch, and consecrated
to the priesthood. These sectaries charged that the
bribe of official position tempted him to forsake his vows;
certain it is that in 1741 he was appointed justice of the
peace for Berks County, and left Ephrata, later (1743)
sending a letter requesting his former brethren to consider
him a “stranger.” The opposition of this sect of Germans,
the indifference of the Moravians, and the alienation
of his earlier Lutheran friends, lost him his coveted election
for the assembly; and he afterwards withdrew from politics
to remain the trusted adviser of the government upon
Indian and local affairs. His sincerity, honesty, and
trustworthiness made him greatly respected throughout
the entire province, and his death, July 13, 1760, was considered
a public calamity.</p>

<p>The journey undertaken to the Ohio, which the accompanying
journal chronicles, was the first official embassy
to the Indians who lived beyond the Alleghenies, and was
undertaken for the following reasons.</p>

<p>The efforts of the English traders to push their connections
among the “far Indians” had been increasingly
successful, during the decade 1738-48, and the resulting
rivalry with the French had reached an intense stage.
The firm hold of the latter on the Indian nations of the
“upper country” had been shaken by a long series of
wars with the Foxes and Chickasaws, accompanied by
humiliating defeats. In 1747, the most faithful of the
French Indians—those domiciled at Mackinac and
Detroit—had risen in revolt; and George Croghan sent
word to the council at Philadelphia that some nations
along the shore of Lake Erie desired the English alliance,
having as an earnest thereof sent a belt of wampum and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
a French scalp.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Pennsylvania authorities voted
them a present of £200, to be sent out by Croghan. About
the same time, a deputation of ten Indians from the Ohio
arriving in Philadelphia, the council considered this “an
extraordinary event in the English favor,” and not only
secured a grant of £1,000 from the assembly, but applied
to the governors of the Southern provinces to aid in this
work; in accordance with which request, Virginia replied
with an appropriation of £200.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Croghan set off in the
spring of 1748, and informed the Allegheny Indians that
Weiser, the official interpreter, would be among them
during the summer. Meanwhile, the latter was detained
by a treaty with the Twigtwee (Miami) Indians, who had
come unexpectedly offering to the English the alliance of
that powerful nation;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> so that it was not until August
that he was able to start on his mission to the Ohio.</p>

<p>In addition to the delivery of the present, he was also
instructed to secure satisfaction for the attack of some
Northern Indians upon the Carolina settlements; wherein
one Captain Haig, with several others, had been carried
off prisoners—supposedly by some Ohio Indians.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
success of this mission was most gratifying to the English
and the frontier settlers. The Virginia authorities
were more active than those of Pennsylvania in following
up the advantage thus gained; and under the leadership
of the Ohio Company sought to secure the Forks of the
Ohio, with the ensuing consequences of the French and
Indian War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>20th. Came to Franks Town, but saw no Houses or
Cabins; here we overtook the Goods,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> because four of
George Croghan’s Hands fell sick, 26 Miles.</p>

<p>26th. Hired a Cannoe; paid 1,000 Black Wampum for
the loan of it to Logs Town. Our Horses being all tyred,
we went by Water &amp; came that Night to a Delaware
Town; the Indians used us very kindly.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>27th. Sett off again in the morning early; Rainy
Wheather. We dined in a Seneka Town, where an old
Seneka Woman Reigns with great Authority;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> we dined
at her House, &amp; they all used us very well; at this &amp;
the last-mentioned Delaware Town they received us by
firing a great many Guns; especially at this last Place.
We saluted the Town by firing off 4 pair of pistols;
arrived that Evening at Logs Town, &amp; Saluted the
Town as before; the Indians returned about One hundred
Guns;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Great Joy appear’d in their Countenances.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
From the Place where we took Water, <i>i. e.</i> from the old
Shawones Town, commonly called Chartier’s Town,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
to this Place is about 60 Miles by Water &amp; but 35 or 40
by Land.</p>

<p>The Indian Council met this Evening to shake Hands
with me &amp; to shew their Satisfaction at my safe arrival;
I desired of them to send a Couple of Canoes to fetch
down the Goods from Chartier’s old Town, where we
had been oblig’d to leave them on account of our Horses
being all tyred. I gave them a String of Wampum to
enforce my Request.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>28th. Lay still.</p>

<p>29th. The Indians sett off in three Canoes to fetch
the Goods. I expected the Goods wou’d be all at Chartier’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
old Town by the time the Canoes wou’d get there,
as we met about twenty Horses of George Croghan’s at
the Shawonese Cabbins in order to fetch the Goods that
were then lying at Franks Town.</p>

<p>This Day news came to Town that the Six Nations
were on the point of declaring War against the French,
for reason the French had Imprison’d some of the Indian
Deputies. A Council was held &amp; all the Indians acquainted
with the News, and it was said the Indian Messenger
was by the way to give all the Indians Notice to
make ready to fight the French.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This Day my Companions
went to Coscosky, a large Indian Town about
30 Miles off.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>30th. I went to Beaver Creek, an Indian Town about
8 Miles off, chiefly Delawares, the rest Mohocks, to have
some Belts of Wampum made.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This afternoon Rainy
Wheather set in which lasted above a Week. Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Montour<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> came back from Coscosky with a Message
from the Indians there to desire of me that the ensuing
Council might be held at their Town. We both lodged
at this Town at George Croghan’s Trading House.</p>

<p>31st. Sent Andrew Montour back to Coscosky with a
String of Wampum to let the Indians there know that it
was an act of their own that the ensuing Council must
be held at Logs Town, they had order’d it do last Spring
when George Croghan was up, &amp; at the last Treaty in
Lancaster the Shawonese &amp; Twightwees<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> have been
told so, &amp; they stayed accordingly for that purpose, &amp;
both would be offended if the Council was to be held at
Coscosky, besides my instructions binds me to Logs
Town, &amp; could not go further without giving offence.</p>

<p>Septʳ. 1. The Indians in Logs Town having heard of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the Message from Coscosky sent for me to know what I
was resolv’d to do, and told me that the Indians at Coscosky
were no more Chiefs than themselves, &amp; that last
Spring they had nothing to eat, &amp; expecting that they
shou’d have nothing to eat at our arrival, order’d that
the Council should be held here; now their Corn is ripe,
they want to remove the Council, but they ought to stand
by their word; we have kept the Twightwees here &amp; our
Brethren the Shawonese from below on that account, as
I told them the Message that I had sent by Andrew
Montour; they were content.</p>

<p>2d. Rain continued; the Indians brought in a good
deal of Venison.</p>

<p>3d. Set up the Union Flagg on a long Pole. Treated
all the Company with a Dram of Rum; The King’s
Health was drank by Indians &amp; white men. Towards
Night a great many Indians arrived to attend the Council.
There was great firing on both sides; the Strangers first
Saluted the Town at a quarter of a Mile distance, and at
their Entry the Town’s People return’d the fire, also the
English Traders, of whom there were above twenty.
At Night, being very sick of the Cholick, I got bled.</p>

<p>4th. Was oblig’d to keep my bed all Day, being very
weak.</p>

<p>5th. I found myself better. Scaiohady<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> came to see
me; had some discourse with him about the ensuing
Council.</p>

<p>6th. Had a Council with the Wondats, otherways
called Ionontady Hagas, they made a fine Speech to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
me to make me welcome, &amp; appeared in the whole very
friendly.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Rainy Wheather continued.</p>

<p>7th. Being inform’d that the Wondats had a mind to
go back again to the French, &amp; had endeavour’d to
take the Delawares with them to recommend them to the
French, I sent Andrew Montour to Beaver Creek with
a string of Wampum to inform himself of the Truth of
the matter; they sent a String in answer to let me know
they had no correspondence that way with the Wondats,
and that the aforesaid Report was false.</p>

<p>8th. Had a Council with the Chiefs of the Wondats;
enquired their number, &amp; what occasion’d them to come
away from the French, What Correspondence they had
with the Six Nations, &amp; whether or no they had ever
had any Correspondence with the Government of New
York; they inform’d me their coming away from the
French was because of the hard Usage they received from
them; That they wou’d always get their Young Men to
go to War against their Enemies, and wou’d use them as
their own People, that is like Slaves, &amp; their Goods
were so dear that they, the Indians, cou’d not buy them;
that there was one hundred fighting Men that came over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
to join the English, seventy were left behind at another
Town a good distance off, &amp; they hoped they wou’d
follow them; that they had a very good Correspondence
with the Six Nations many Years, &amp; were one People
with them, that they cou’d wish the Six Nations wou’d
act more brisker against the French; That above fifty
Years ago they made a Treaty of Friendship with the
Governor of New York at Albany, &amp; shewed me a large
Belt of Wampum they received there from the said
Governor as from the King of Great Britain; the Belt
was 25 Grains wide &amp; 265 long, very Curiously wrought,
there were seven Images of Men holding one another by
the Hand, the 1st signifying the Governor of New York
(or rather, as they said, the King of Great Britain), the
2d the Mohawks, the 3d the Oneidos, the 4th the Cajugas,
the 5th the Onondagers, the 6th the Senekas, the 7th the
Owandaets [Wyandots], the two Rows of black Wampum
under their feet thro’ the whole length of the Belt to
signify the Road from Albany thro’ the 5 Nations to the
Owendaets; That 6 Years ago, they had sent Deputies
with the same Belt to Albany to renew the Friendship.</p>

<p>I treated them with a quart of Whiskey &amp; a Roll of
Tobacco; they expressed their good Wishes to King
George &amp; all his People, &amp; were mightily pleas’d that I
look’d upon them as Brethren of the English.</p>

<p>This Day I desir’d the Deputies of all the Nations of
Indians settled on the Waters of Ohio to give me a List
of their fighting Men, which they promis’d to do. A
great many of the Indians went away this Day because
the Goods did not come, &amp; the People in the Town
cou’d not find Provision enough, the number was so
great.</p>

<p>The following is the number of every Nation, given to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
me by their several Deputies in Council, in so many
Sticks tied up in a Bundle:</p>

<p>The Senacas 163, Shawonese 162, Owendaets 100,
Tisagechroanu 40; Mohawks 74; Mohickons 15; Onondagers
35; Cajukas 20; Oneidos 15; Delawares 165; in
all 789.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>9th. I had a Council with the Senakas, &amp; gave them
a large String of Wampum, black &amp; White, to acquaint
them I had it in Charge from the President &amp; Council
in Philadelphia to enquire who it was that lately took
the People Prisoners in Carolina, one thereof being a
Great man, &amp; that by what discovery I had already
made I found it was some of the Senekas did it; I therefore
desir’d them to give me their Reasons for doing so,
&amp; as they had struck their Hatchet into their Brethren’s
Body they cou’d not expect that I could deliver my
Message with a good heart before they gave me Satisfaction
in that Respect, for they must consider the English,
tho’ living in several Provinces, are all one People, &amp;
doing Mischeif to one is doing to the other; let me have
a plain &amp; direct answer.</p>

<p>10th. A great many of the Indians got drunk; one
Henry Noland had brought near 30 Gallons of Whiskey
to the Town. This Day I made a Present to the old
Shawonese Chief Cackawatcheky, of a Stroud, a Blanket,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
a Match Coat,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> a Shirt, a Pair of Stockings, &amp; a large
twist of Tobacco, &amp; told him that the President &amp;
Council of Philadelphia remember’d their love to him
as to their old &amp; true Friend, &amp; wou’d Cloath his Body
once more, &amp; wished he might weare them out so as to
give them an opportunity to cloath him again. There
was a great many Indians present, two of which were the
big Hominy &amp; the Pride, those that went off with Chartier,
but protested against his proceedings against our
Traders. Catchawatcheky return’d thanks, &amp; some of
the Six Nations did the same, &amp; express’d their Satisfaction
to see a true man taken Notice of, altho’ he was
now grown Childish.</p>

<p>11th. George Croghan &amp; myself staved an 8 Gallon
Cag of Liquor belonging to the aforesaid Henry Norland,
who could not be prevail’d on to hide it in the Woods,
but would sell it &amp; get drunk himselfe.</p>

<p>I desir’d some of the Indians in Council to send some
of their Young Men to meet our People with the Goods,
and not to come back before they heard of or saw them.
I begun to be afraid they had fallen into the Hands of the
Enemy; so did the Indians.</p>

<p>Ten Warriors came to Town by Water from Niagara;
We suspected them very much, &amp; fear’d that some of their
Parties went to meet our People by hearing of them.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>12th. Two Indians and a white man<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> went out to meet
our People, &amp; had Orders not to come back before they
saw them, or go to Franks Town, where we left the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Goods. The same Day the Indians made answer to my
Request concerning the Prisoners taken in Carolina:
Thanayieson, a Speaker of the Senekas, spoke to the
following purpose in the presence of all the Deputies
of the other Nations (We were out of Doors): “Brethren,
You came a great way to visit us, &amp; many sorts of Evils
might have befallen You by the way which might have
been hurtful to your Eyes &amp; your inward parts, for the
Woods are full of Evil Spirits. We give You this String
of Wampum to clear up your Eyes &amp; Minds &amp; to remove
all bitterness of your Spirit, that you may hear us
speak in good Chear.” Then the Speaker took his
Belt in his Hand &amp; said: “Brethren, when we and you
first saw one another at your first arrival at Albany we
shook Hands together and became Brethren &amp; we tyed
your Ship to the Bushes, and after we had more acquaintance
with you we lov’d you more and more, &amp; perceiving
that a Bush wou’d not hold your Vessel we then tyed
her to a large Tree &amp; ever after good Friendship continued
between us; afterwards you, our Brethren, told
us that a Tree might happen to fall down and the Rope
rot wherewith the Ship was tyed. You then proposed
to make a Silver Chain &amp; tye your Ship to the great
Mountains in the five Nations’ Country, &amp; that Chain
was called the Chain of Friendship; we were all tyed by
our Arms together with it, &amp; we the Indians of the five
Nations heartily agreed to it, &amp; ever since a very good
Correspondence have been kept between us; but we are
very sorry that at your coming here we are oblig’d to
talk of the Accident that lately befell you in Carolina,
where some of our Warriors, by the Instigation of the
Evil Spirit, struck their Hatchet into our own Body like,
for our Brethren the English &amp; we are of one Body, &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
what was done we utterly abhor as a thing done by the
Evil Spirit himself; we never expected any of our People
wou’d ever do so to our Brethren. We therefore remove
our Hatchet which, by the influence of the Evil Spirit, was
struck into your Body, and we desire that our Brethren
the Govʳ. of New York &amp; Onas<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> may use their utmost
endeavours that the thing may be buried in the bottomless
Pit, that it may never be seen again—that the Chain of
Friendship which is of so long standing may be preserv’d
bright &amp; unhurt.” Gave a Belt. The Speaker then
took up a String of Wampum, mostly black, and said:
“Brethren, as we have removed our Hatchet out of your
Body, or properly speaking, out of our own, We now
desire that the Air may be clear’d up again &amp; the wound
given may be healed, &amp; every thing put in good understanding,
as it was before, and we desire you will assist
us to make up everything with the Govʳ. of Carolina;
the Man that has been brought as a Prisoner we now
deliver to You, he is yours” (lay’d down the String, and
took the Prisoner by the Hand and delivered him to
me).<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> By way of discourse, the Speaker said, “the
Six Nation Warriors often meet Englishmen trading to
the Catawbas, &amp; often found that the Englishmen
betrayed them to their Enemy, &amp; some of the English
Traders had been spoke to by the Indian Speaker last
Year in the Cherrykees<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Country &amp; were told not to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
so; that the Speaker &amp; many others of the Six Nations
had been afraid a long time that such a thing wou’d be
done by some of their Warriors at one time or other.”</p>

<p>13th. Had a Council with the Senekas and Onontagers
about the Wandots, to receive them into our
Union. I gave a large Belt of Wampum and the Indians
gave two, &amp; everything was agreed upon about what
sho’d be said to the Wandots. The same Evening a
full Council was appointed &amp; met accordingly, &amp; a
Speech was made to the Wandots by Asserhartur, a
Seneka, as follows:</p>

<p>“Brethren, the Ionontady Hagas:<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> last Spring you
sent this Belt of Wampum to Us (having the Belt then in
his hand) to desire us and our Brethren, the Shawonese &amp;
our Cousins the Delawares, to come &amp; meet you in your
retreat from the French, &amp; we accordingly came to your
Assistance &amp; brought you here &amp; received you as our
own flesh. We desire you will think you now join us, &amp;
our Brethren, the English, &amp; you are become one People
with us”—then he lay’d that Belt by &amp; gave them a
very large String of Wampum.</p>

<p>The Speaker took up the Belt I gave &amp; said: “Brethren:
the English, our Brothers, bid you welcome &amp; are
glad you escaped out Captivity like: You have been
kept as Slaves by Onontio,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> notwithstanding he call’d
You all along his Children, but now You have broke the
Rope wherewith you have been tyed &amp; become Freemen,
&amp; we, the united Six Nations, receive you to our Council
Fire, &amp; make you Members thereof, and we will secure
your dwelling Place to You against all manner of danger.”—Gave
the Belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“Brethren: We the Six United Nations &amp; all our
Indian Allies, with our Brethren the English, look upon
you as our Children, tho’ you are our Brethren; we desire
you will give no ear to the Evil Spirit that spreads
lyes &amp; wickedness, let your mind by easy &amp; clear, &amp;
be of the same mind with us whatever you may hear,
nothing shall befall you but what of necessity must befall
us at the same time.</p>

<p>“Brethren: We are extremely pleased to see you
here, as it happened just at the same time when our
Brother Onas is with us. We jointly, by this Belt of
Wampum, embrace you about your middle, &amp; desire
you to be strong in your minds &amp; hearts, let nothing
alter your minds, but live &amp; dye with us.” Gave a Belt—the
Council broke up.</p>

<p>14th. A full Council was Summon’d &amp; every thing
repeated by me to all the Indians of what pass’d in Lancaster
at the last Treaty with the Twightwees.</p>

<p>The News was confirm’d by a Belt of Wampum from
the Six Nations, that the French had imprisoned some of
the Six Nations Deputies, &amp; 30 of the Wandots, including
Women &amp; Children.</p>

<p>The Indians that were sent to meet our People with the
Goods came back &amp; did not see any thing of them, but
they had been no further than the old Shawonese Town.</p>

<p>15th. I let the Indians know that I wou’d deliver my
Message to morrow, &amp; the Goods I had, &amp; that they
must send Deputies with me on my returning homewards,
&amp; wherever we shou’d meet the rest of the Goods I
wou’d send them to them if they were not taken by the
Enemy, to which they agreed.</p>

<p>The same Day the Delawares made a Speech to me
&amp; presented a Beaver Coat &amp; a String of Wampum, &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
said, “Brother: we let the President &amp; Council of Phila.
know that after the Death of our Chief Man, Olomipies,
our Grand Children the Shawnese<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> came to our own
Town to condole with us over the loss of our good King,
your Brother, &amp; they wiped off our Tears &amp; comforted
our minds, &amp; as the Delawares are the same People
with the Pennsylvanians, &amp; born in one &amp; the same
Country, we give some of the Present our Grand Children
gave us to the President &amp; Council of Philda. because
the Death of their good Friend &amp; Brother must have
affected them as well as us.”—Gave the Beaver Coat &amp;
a String of Wampum.</p>

<p>The same Day the Wandots sent for me &amp; Andrew &amp;
presented us with 7 Beaver Skins about 10 lbs. weight, &amp;
said they gave us that to buy some refreshments for us
after our arrival in Pennsylvania, wished we might get
home safe, &amp; lifted up their Hands &amp; said they wou’d
pray God to protect us &amp; guide us the way home. I
desir’d to know their names; they behav’d like People of
good Sense &amp; Sincerity; the most of them were grey
headed; their Names are as follows: Totornihiades,
Taganayesy, Sonachqua, Wanduny, Taruchiorus, their
Speaker. The Chiefs of the Delawares that made the
above Speech are Shawanasson &amp; Achamanatainu.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>16th. I made answer to the Delawares &amp; said, “Brethren
the Delawares: It is true what you said that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
People of Pennsylvania are your Brethren &amp; Countrymen;
we are very well pleas’d of what your Children
the Shawonese did to you; this is the first time we had
publick Notice given us of the Death of our good Friend
&amp; Brother Olomipies. I take this opportunity to remove
the remainder of your Troubles from your Hearts
to enable you to attend in Council at the ensuing Treaty,
&amp; I assure you that the President &amp; Council of Pennsylvania
condoles with You over the loss of your King our
good Friend and Brother.”—Gave them 5 Strouds.</p>

<p>The two aforesaid Chiefs gave a String of Wampum &amp;
desir’d me to let their Brethren, the President &amp; Council,
know they intended a Journey next Spring to Philadelphia
to consult with their Brethren over some Affairs of
Moment; since they are now like Orphan Children,
they hoped their Brethren wou’d let them have their
good Advice and Assistance, as the People of Pennsylvania
&amp; the Delawares were like one Family.</p>

<p>The same Day the rest of the Goods arriv’d the Men
said they had nine Days’ Rain &amp; the Creeks arose, &amp;
that they had been oblig’d to send a sick Man back from
Franks Town to the Inhabitants with another to attend
him.</p>

<p>The neighboring Indians being sent for again, the
Council was appointed to meet to-morrow. It rain’d again.</p>

<p>17th. It rained very hard, but in the Afternoon it held
up for about 3 hours; the Deputies of the several Nations
met in Council &amp; I delivered them what I had to say
from the President &amp; Council of Pennsylvania by Andrew
Montour.</p>

<p>“Brethren, you that live on Ohio: I am sent to You
by the President &amp; Council of Pennsylvania, &amp; I am
now going to Speak to You on their behalf I desire You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
will take Notice &amp; hear what I shall say.”—Gave a
String of Wampum.</p>

<p>“Brethren: Some of You have been in Philadelphia
last Fall &amp; acquainted us that You had taken up the
English Hatchet, and that You had already made use of
it against the French, &amp; that the French had very hard
heads, &amp; your Country afforded nothing but Sticks &amp;
Hickerys which was not sufficient to break them. You
desir’d your Brethren wou’d assist You with some Weapons
sufficient to do it. Your Brethren the Presidᵗ. &amp;
Council promis’d you then to send something to You
next Spring by Tharachiawagon,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but as some other
Affairs prevented his Journey to Ohio, you receiv’d a
Supply by George Croghan sent you by your said Brethren;
but before George Croghan came back from Ohio
News came from over the Great Lake that the King of
Great Britain &amp; the French King had agreed upon a
Cessation of Arms for Six Months &amp; that a Peace was
very likely to follow. Your Brethren, the President &amp;
Council, were then in a manner at a loss what to do. It
did not become them to act contrary to the command of
the King, and it was out of their Power to encourage you
in the War against the French; but as your Brethren
never miss’d fulfilling their Promises, they have upon
second Consideration thought proper to turn the intended
Supply into a Civil &amp; Brotherly Present, and have
accordingly sent me with it, and here are the Goods before
your Eyes, which I have, by your Brethren’s Order,
divided into 5 Shares &amp; layd in 5 different heaps, one
heap whereof your Brother Assaraquoa sent to You to
remember his Friendship and Unity with You; &amp; as
you are all of the same Nations with whom we the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
have been in League of Friendship, nothing need be
said more than this, that the President &amp; Council &amp;
Assaraquoa<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> have sent You this Present to serve to
strengthen the Chain of Friendship between us the
English &amp; the several Nations of Indians to which You
belong. A French Peace is a very uncertain One, they
keep it no longer than their Interest permits, then they
break it without provocation given them. The French
King’s People have been almost starv’d in old France
for want of Provision, which made them wish &amp; seek
for Peace; but our wise People are of opinion that after
their Bellies are full they will quarrel again &amp; raise a
War. All nations in Europe know that their Friendship
is mix’d with Poison, &amp; many that trusted too much on
their Friendship have been ruin’d.</p>

<p>“I now conclude &amp; say, that we the English are your
true Brethren at all Events, In token whereof receive
this Present.” The Goods being then uncover’d I proceeded.
“Brethren: You have of late settled the
River of Ohio for the sake of Hunting, &amp; our Traders
followed you for the sake of Hunting also. You have
invited them yourselves. Your Brethren, the President
&amp; Council, desire You will look upon them as your
Brethren &amp; see that they have justice done. Some of
your Young Men have robbed our Traders, but you will
be so honest as to compel them to make Satisfaction.
You are now become a People of Note, &amp; are grown
very numerous of late Years, &amp; there is no doubt some
wise Men among you, it therefore becomes you to Act
the part of wise men, &amp; for the future be more regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
than You have been for some Years past, when only a
few Young Hunters lived here.”—Gave a Belt.</p>

<p>“Brethren: You have of late made frequent Complaints
against the Traders bringing so much Rum to
your Towns, &amp; desir’d it might be stop’t; &amp; your Brethren
the President &amp; Council made an Act accordingly &amp;
put a stop to it, &amp; no Trader was to bring any Rum or
strong Liquor to your Towns. I have the Act here with
me &amp; shall explain it to You before I leave you;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But
it seems it is out of your Brethren’s Power to stop it
entirely. You send down your own Skins by the Traders
to buy Rum for you. You go yourselves &amp; fetch Horse
loads of strong Liquor. But the other Day an Indian
came to this Town out of Maryland with 3 Horse loads
of Liquor, so that it appears you love it so well that you
cannot be without it. You know very well that the
Country near the endless Mountain affords strong Liquor,
&amp; the moment the Traders buy it they are gone out of the
Inhabitants &amp; are travelling to this Place without being
discover’d; besides this, you never agree about it—one
will have it, the other won’t (tho’ very few), a third says
we will have it cheaper; this last we believe is spoken from
your Hearts (here they Laughed). Your Brethren,
therefore, have order’d that every cask of Whiskey shall
be sold to You for 5 Bucks in your Town, &amp; if a Trader
offers to sell Whiskey to You and will not let you have it
at that Price, you may take it from him &amp; drink it for
nothing.”—Gave a Belt.</p>

<p>“Brethren: Here is one of the Traders who you know
to be a very sober &amp; honest Man; he has been robbed of
the value of 300 Bucks, &amp; you all know by whom; let,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
therefore, Satisfaction be made to the Trader.”—Gave
a String of Wampum.</p>

<p>“Brethren, I have no more to say.”</p>

<p>I delivered the Goods to them, having first divided them
into 5 Shares—a Share to the Senekas, another to the
Cajukas, Oneidos, the Onontagers, &amp; Mohawks, another
to the Delawares, another to the Owendaets, Tisagechroanu,
&amp; Mohickons, and the other to the Shawonese.</p>

<p>The Indians signified great Satisfaction &amp; were well
pleased with the Cessation of Arms. The Rainy Wheather
hasted them away with the Goods into the Houses.</p>

<p>18th. The Speech was delivered to the Delawares in
their own Language, &amp; also to the Shawonese in their’s,
by Andrew Montour, in the presence of the Gentlemen
that accompanied me.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> I acquainted the Indians I was
determined to leave them to-morrow &amp; return homewards.</p>

<p>19th. Scaiohady, Tannghrishon, Oniadagarehra, with
a few more, came to my lodging &amp; spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“Brother Onas, We desire you will hear what we are
going to say to You in behalf of all the Indians on Ohio;
their Deputies have sent us to You. We have heard
what you have said to us, &amp; we return you many thanks
for your kindness in informing us of what pass’d between
the King of Great Britain &amp; the French King, and in
particular we return you many thanks for the large
Presents; the same we do to our Brother Assaraquoa,
who joined our Brother Onas in making us a Present.
Our Brethren have indeed tied our Hearts to their’s.
We at present can but return thanks with an empty hand
till another opportunity serves to do it sufficiently. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
must call a great Council &amp; do every thing regular; in
the mean time look upon us as your true Brothers.</p>

<p>“Brother: You said the other Day in Council if any
thing befell us from the French we must let you know of it.
We will let you know if we hear any thing from the French,
be it against us or yourself. You will have Peace, but it’s
most certain that the Six Nations &amp; their Allies are upon
the point of declaring War against the French. Let us
keep up true Corrispondence &amp; always hear of one
another.”—They gave a Belt.</p>

<p>Scaiohady &amp; the half King, with two others, had inform’d
me that they often must send Messengers to Indian
Towns &amp; Nations, &amp; had nothing in their Council Bag,
as they were new beginners, either to recompense a Messenger
or to get Wampum to do the business, &amp; begged
I wou’d assist them with something. I had saved a
Piece of Strowd, an half Barrell of Pow[d]er, 100 pounds
of Lead, 10 Shirts, 6 Knives, &amp; 1 Pound of Vermillion, &amp;
gave it to them for the aforesaid use; they return’d many
thanks and were mightily pleased.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>The same Day I set out for Pennsylvania in Rainy
Weather, and arrived at George Croghan’s on the 28th
Instant.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Weiser’s house was about one mile east of Womelsdorf, now in Berks
County, Pennsylvania. James Galbreath was a prominent Indian trader, one
of those licensed by the government of Pennsylvania.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Croghan lived at this time just west of Harrisburg in Pennsboro Township,
Cumberland County.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> There were three great Indian paths from east to west through Western
Pennsylvania. The southern led from Fort Cumberland on the Potomac, westward
through the valleys of Youghiogheny and Monongahela, to the Forks of
the Ohio, and was the route taken by Washington in 1753, later by Braddock’s
expedition, and was substantially the line of the great Cumberland
National Road of the early nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The central trail, passing through Carlisle, Shippensburg, and Bedford, over
Laurel Mountain, through Fort Ligonier, over Chestnut Ridge, to Shannopin’s
Town at the Forks of the Ohio, was the most direct, and became the basis of
General Forbes’s road, and later of the Pennsylvania wagon road to the
Ohio. Gist took this trail in 1750.—See Hulbert, <i>Old Glade Road</i> (Cleveland,
1903).</p>

<p>The northern, or Kittanning trail, was the oldest, and that most used by
Indian traders. It is this route that Weiser followed. From Croghan’s, he
passed over into the valley of Sherman’s Creek (in Perry County), crossed the
Tuscarora Mountains at what was later known as Sterritt’s Gap, and reached
the Black Log sleeping place near Shade Valley in the southeastern part of
Huntingdon County. This was a digression to the south, for in an extract
from his journal in <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, ii, p. 13, Weiser says: “The Black Log
is 8 or 10 miles South East of the Three Springs and Frank’s Town lies to yᵉ
North, so that there must be a deduction of at least twenty miles.” From here,
following the valley of Aughwick Creek, he crossed the Juniata River, and
approached the “Standing Stone.” This was a prominent landmark of the
region, and stood on the right bank of a creek of the same name, near the
present town of Huntingdon. It was about 14 feet high, and six inches square,
and served as a kind of Indian guidepost for that region. From this point,
the trail followed the Juniata Valley, coinciding for a short distance with the
line of the Pennsylvania Central Railway, but turning off on the Frankstown
branch of the Juniata at the present town of Petersburg.</p>

<p>There was also a fourth trail, still farther north, by way of Sunbury and
the west branch of the Susquehanna to Venango. This was Post’s route in
1758.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> Frankstown was an important Indian village in the county of Blair, near
Hollidaysburg. The present town of this name lies on the north side of the
river, whereas the Indian town appears to have been on the south bank. Remains
of the native village were in existence in the early part of the nineteenth
century. The Indian name was “Assunepachla,” the title “Frankstown”
being given in honor of Stephen Franks, a German trader who lived at this
place.—See Jones, <i>History of Juniata Valley</i> (Harrisburg, 1889, 2nd ed.),
pp. 298-303. The cause of its desertion when Weiser passed, is not known.
The other edition of the journal says, “Here we overtook one half the goods,”
which seems more correct in view of the succeeding account.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> Of the place where the Kittanning trail crosses the Allegheny Range,
Jones writes (<i>op. cit.</i>), that the path is still visible, although filled with
weeds in the summer. “In some places where the ground was marshy, close
to the run, the path is at least twelve inches deep, and the very stones along
the road bear the marks of the iron-shod horses of the Indian traders. Two
years ago we picked up, at the edge of the run, a mile up the gorge, two gun-flints,—now
rated as relics of a past age.” Clear fields was at the head waters
of Clearfield Creek, a branch of the Susquehanna River, in Clearfield Township,
Cambria County. This is not to be confused with Clearfield (Chinklacamoos),
an important Indian town farther north. See <a href="#JOURNAL_POST_I">Post’s <i>Journal</i>, <i>post</i></a>.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> The Shawnees (Fr., Chaouanons), when first known, appear to have been
living in Western Kentucky; they were greatly harassed by the Iroquois, and
made frequent migrations which are difficult to trace. In 1692, they made
peace with the Iroquois and the English, and portions of the tribe settled in
the Ohio country and Western Pennsylvania. Intriguing with both English
and French, they were treacherous toward both nations. The location of
the cabins mentioned here by Weiser is not positively known—it was in the
northern part of Indiana County; somewhere on the Kittanning trail.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> Weiser turned aside from the regular trail that ended at the Delaware
Indians’ town of Kittanning, and followed a branch of the path that turned
southwest; crossed the Kiskiminitas Creek at the ford where the town of
Saltzburg, Indiana County, now stands; and reached the Allegheny River
(then called the Ohio) at Chartier’s Old Town, now Chartier’s Station, Westmoreland
County. It was at this point that in 1749, the French explorer, Céloron
de Blainville, met six traders with fifty horses laden with peltries, by these
sending his famous message to the governor of Pennsylvania to keep his traders
from that country, which was owned by the French. Weiser calculated the
distance of his journey by land as one hundred and seventy miles, and by deducting
twenty miles for the detour at Black Log, made the distance from the
settlements one hundred and fifty miles.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> This was the Delaware village known as Shannopin’s Town, from a chief
of that name, who died in 1749. It was situated on the Allegheny River in the
present city of Pittsburg, and contained about twenty wigwams, and fifty or sixty
natives. See Darlington, <i>Gist’s Journals</i> (Pittsburg, 1893), pp. 92, 93.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> The reference is to Queen Aliquippa, whose town, directly at the Forks of
the Ohio, was called by Céloron “the written rock village.” The writings
proved on examination to be but names of English traders scrawled in charcoal
on the rocks. See Father Bonnécamps’s Relation, <i>Jesuit Relations</i> (Thwaites’s
ed., Cleveland, 1896-1902), lxix, p. 175. Céloron says of the Seneca queen:
“She regards herself as a sovereign, and is entirely devoted to the English.”
Upon the advent of the French, she removed her village to the forks of the
Monongahela and Youghiogheny, where she told Gist in 1753 she would
never go back to the Allegheny to live, unless the English built a fort. Céloron
says of the site of her first village: “This place is one of the most beautiful I
have seen on the Beautiful River [la Belle Rivière, the French name for the
Ohio].”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> Logstown (French, Chinnigné, Shenango) was the most important
Indian trading village in that part of the country. It was a mixed village composed
of Indians of several tribes—chiefly Iroquois, Mohican, and Shawnee.
When Céloron visited it a year after Weiser’s sojourn, he spoke of it as “a very
bad village, seduced by the desire for the cheap goods of the English.” He
was near being attacked here, being saved by discovering the plot, and displaying
the strength of his forces. Like Weiser, he was received with a salute
of guns, but feared it was more a sign of enmity than amity. Later, the Indians
of this village returned to the French alliance, and after the founding of Fort
Duquesne, houses were built by the French for its inhabitants. With the
restoration of English interest, the importance of the place diminished, and by
1784 it is spoken of as a “former settlement.” The site of Logstown is about
eighteen miles down the river from Pittsburg, just below the present town of
Economy, Pennsylvania. It was on a high bluff on the north shore. For the
history of this place, see Darlington’s <i>Gist</i>, pp. 95-100.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> There were two Indian towns called by this name—one at the mouth
of Chartier’s Creek, Allegheny County, three miles below Pittsburg; the other
opposite the mouth of Chartier’s Run, which falls into the Allegheny in Westmoreland
County. Weiser refers to the latter of these. Chartier was a
French-Shawnee half-breed that had much influence with his tribe. In 1745,
he induced most of them to remove to the neighborhood of Detroit, on the orders
of the governor of New France. See <a href="#JOURNAL_CROGHAN">Croghan’s <i>Journals</i>, <i>post</i></a>.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> The other edition of the journal adds, that the horses were “all scalled
on their backs.”</p>

<p>The importance of “wampum” in all Indian transactions cannot be overestimated.
It was used for money, as a much-prized ornament, to enforce a
request (as at this time), to accredit a messenger, to ransom a prisoner, to
atone for a crime. No council could be held, no treaty drawn up, without a
liberal use of wampum. It was used also to record treaties, as the one described
by Weiser between the Wyandots, Iroquois, and governor of New York. Hale—“Indian
Wampum Records,” <i>Popular Science Monthly</i>, February, 1897—thinks
that it was a comparatively late invention in Indian development, and
took its rise among the Iroquois. Weiser’s list of the wampum used and

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> The French had retained the Iroquois deputies in order to secure from
them the French prisoners in their hands. La Galissonière, the governor
wrote to his home government in 1748, that he should persist in retaining their
(the Iroquois) people, until he recovered the French. The governor of New
York demanded the Mohawks, on the ground of their being British subjects,
a claim the French refused to admit. The matter was finally adjusted without
an Indian war, although it caused much irritation. See O’Callaghan (ed.),

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> Kuskuskis was an important centre for the Delaware Indians, on the
Mahoning Branch of Beaver Creek, in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. It
consisted of separate villages scattered along the creek, one of which, called
“Old Kuskuskis,” was at the forks, where New Castle now stands. See

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> The Indian town at the mouth of Beaver Creek, where the town of Beaver
now stands, was known indifferently as King Beaver’s, or Shingas’s Old Town
(from two noted Delaware chiefs), or Sohkon (signifying “at the mouth of a
stream”). This was a noted fur-trading station, and after the building of
Fort Duquesne, the French erected houses here, for the Indians. It was the
starting place for many a border raid, that made Shingas’s name “a terror to
the frontier settlements of Pennsylvania.” See Post’s experiences at this place

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Andrew Montour was the son of a noted French half-breed, Madame
Montour, who being captured by the Iroquois in her youth married an Oneida
chief and was a firm adherent of the English. Montour’s services for the English
were considerable. He was an expert interpreter, speaking the languages of
the various Ohio Indians, as well as Iroquois. First mentioned by Weiser in
1744, when he interpreted Delaware for his Iroquois, he assisted in nearly all
the important Indian negotiations from that time until the treaty of Fort Stanwix
in 1768, being employed in turn by the Pennsylvania, Virginia, and New York
governments, and the Ohio Company. In 1754, he was with Washington at
the surrender of Fort Necessity. Several times he warned the settlements of
impending raids, among other services bringing word of Pontiac’s outbreak.
He accompanied Major Rogers as captain of the Indian forces, when the latter
went to take possession of Detroit; and in 1764 commanded a party against
the recalcitrant Delawares. He received for his services several grants of land
in Western Pennsylvania, as well as money. For a detailed biography see

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> Twigtwees was the English name for the Miamis, a large nation of Algonquian
Indians, that were first met by the seventeenth century explorers in
Northern Illinois. But later, they moved eastward into the present state of
Indiana, and settled on the Maumee and Wabash rivers, also on St. Josephs
River in Michigan. The French had had posts among them for two generations,
but from 1723 the English traders had been seeking a foothold in their
midst. Their adherence to the English in 1748 was a blow to the French
trade.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> Scarroyahy was an Oneida chief of great influence with the Ohio Indians,
especially at Logstown. He remained firm in the English interest, and in 1754
moved to Aughwick Creek, to get away from the French influence, and to
protect the settlements. His death the same year, was imputed by his friends
to French witchcraft.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> The Wyandots, or Tobacco Hurons, or Petuns, were of Iroquois stock,
but nearly destroyed by that nation in the seventeenth century. Fleeing westward,
they placed themselves under French protection, and, after its founding
in 1701, were settled chiefly about Detroit. In the early eighteenth century
they straggled eastward along the south shore of Lake Erie, and began to open
communication with their ancient enemies, the Iroquois. In 1747, occurred
the rebellion of their chief Nicholas, who built a fort in the marshes of the
Sandusky, and defied the French soldiers. The chiefs whom Weiser met,
were deputies from this party of rebels.</p>

<p>The other edition of Weiser’s journal does not mention the “Wondats”
until September 7; and has the following entry for September 6: “One canoe
with goods arrived, the rest did not come to the river. The Indians that brought
the goods found our casks of whiskey hid by some of the traders; they had
drunk two and brought two to the town. The Indians all got drunk to-night,
and some of the traders along with them. The weather cleared up.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

small shot to enable her to send out the Indian boys to kill turkeys and other
fowls for her, whilst the men are gone to war against the French, that they
may not be starved. I told her I had heard nothing of her message, but if
she had told me of it before I had parted with all the powder and lead, I could
have let her have some, and promised I would make inquiry; perhaps her
messenger had lost it on the way to Philadelphia. I gave her a shirt, a Dutch

</div>

<p>Next to Sir William Johnson, George Croghan was the
most prominent figure among British Indian agents during
the period of the later French wars, and the conspiracy of
Pontiac. A history of his life is therefore an epitome of
Indian relations with the whites, especially on the borders
of Virginia and Pennsylvania and in the Ohio Valley. A
pioneer trader and traveller, and a government agent, no
other man of his time better knew the West and the
counter currents that went to make up its history. Not
even the indefatigable Gist, or the self-sacrificing Post,
travelled over so large a portion of the Western country,
knew better the different routes, or was more welcome
in the Indian villages. Among his own class he was
the “mere idol of the Irish traders.” Sir William Johnson
appreciated his services, made him his deputy for
the Ohio Indians, and entrusted him with the most delicate
and difficult negotiations, such as those at Fort Pitt
and Detroit in 1758-61; and those in the Illinois (1765) by
which Pontiac was brought to terms.</p>

<p>Born in Ireland and educated at Dublin, Croghan
emigrated to Pennsylvania at an early age and settled just
west of Harris’s Ferry in the township of Pennsboro, then
on the border of Western settlement. The opportunities
of the Indian trade appealed to his fondness for journeying
and sense of adventure. His daring soon carried him
beyond the bounds of the province, and among the “far
Indians” of Sandusky and the Lake Erie region, where
he won adherents for the English among the wavering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
allies of the French. His abilities and his influence over
the Indians soon attracted the attention of the hard-headed
German, Conrad Weiser, who in 1747 recommended him
to the Council of Pennsylvania. In this manner he entered
the public service, and continued therein throughout the
active years of his life.</p>

<p>Croghan was first employed by the province in assisting
Weiser to convey a present to the Ohio, whither he
preceded him in the spring of 1748.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The following year
he was sent out to report on the French expedition whose
passage down the Ohio had alarmed the Allegheny
Indians, and arrived at Logstown just after Céloron had
passed, thus neutralizing the latter’s influence in that
region.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The jealousy of the Indians over the encroachments of
the settlers upon their lands west of the mountains on the
Juniata, and in the central valleys of Pennsylvania,
determined the government to expel the settlers rather
than risk a breach with the Indians. In this task, which
must have been uncongenial to him, Croghan, as justice
of the peace for Cumberland County, was employed during
the spring of 1750.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The autumn of the same year,
found him beginning one of his most extensive journeys
throughout the Ohio Valley, as far as the Miamis and
Pickawillany, where he made an advantageous treaty
with new envoys of the Western tribes who sought his
alliance. To Croghan’s annoyance, the Pennsylvania
government in an access of caution repudiated this treaty
as having been unauthorized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>In 1751 Croghan was again upon the Allegheny, encouraging
the Indians in their English alliance, and
defeating Joncaire, the shrewdest of the French agents in
this region, by means of his own tactics. The next year,
he was pursuing his traffic in furs among the Shawnees,
but without forgetting the public interest;<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the following
year finds him assisting the governor and Council
at the important negotiations at Carlisle.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This same
year (1753) Croghan removed his home some distance
west, and settled on Aughwick Creek upon land granted
him by the Province. His public services were continued
early in the next year by a journey with the official
present to the Ohio, where he arrived soon after Washington
had passed upon the return from the famous
embassy to the French officers at Fort Le Bœuf.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the French and Indian War ruined
Croghan’s prosperous trading business, and brought him
to the verge of bankruptcy. While at the same time a
large number of Indian refugees, desiring to remain under
British protection, sought his home at Aughwick, where
he felt obliged to provision them, with but meagre assistance
from the Province. To add to his troubles, the Irish
traders, because of their Romanist proclivities, fell under
suspicion of acting as French spies, and Croghan was
unjustly eyed askance by many in authority.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Although
he was granted a captain’s commission to command the
Indian contingent during Braddock’s campaign, he resigned
this office early in 1756, and retired from the
Pennsylvania service.</p>

<p>About this time he paid a visit to New York, where his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>distant relative, Sir William Johnson, appreciating his
abilities, chose him deputy Indian agent, and appointed
him to manage the Susquehanna and Allegheny tribes.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
From this time forward he was engaged in important
dealings with the natives, swaying them to the British
interest, making possible the success of Forbes (1758),
and the victory of Prideaux and Johnson (1759). After
the capitulation of Montreal, he accompanied Major
Rogers to Detroit. All of 1761 and 1762 were occupied
with Indian conferences and negotiations, in the course
of which he again visited Detroit, meeting Sir William
Johnson en route.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Late in 1763, Croghan went to England on private
business, and was shipwrecked upon the coast of France;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
but finally reached London, where he presented to the
lords of trade an important memorial on Indian affairs.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Upon his return to America (1765), he was at once dispatched
to the Illinois. Proceeding by the Ohio River,
he was made prisoner near the mouth of the Wabash,
and carried to the Indian towns upon that river, where
he not only secured his own release, but conducted
negotiations which put an end to Pontiac’s War, and
opened the Illinois to the British.</p>

<p>A second journey to the Illinois, in the following year,
resulted in his reaching Fort Chartres, and proceeding
thence to New Orleans. No journal of this voyage
has to our knowledge been preserved.</p>

<p>Croghan’s part in the treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
rewarded by a grant of land in Cherry Valley, New
York. Previous to this he had purchased a tract on the
Allegheny about four miles above Pittsburg, where in
1770 he entertained Washington. At the beginning of
the Revolution he appears to have embarked in the
patriot cause,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but later was an object of suspicion; and
in 1778 was proclaimed by Pennsylvania as a public
enemy, his place as Indian agent being conferred upon
Colonel George Morgan. He continued, however, to
reside in Pennsylvania, and died at Passyunk in 1782.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In our selection of material from the large amount of
Croghan’s published work, we have chosen that which
exemplifies Western conditions under three aspects:
First, the period of English ascendency on the Ohio,
which is illustrated by three documents of 1750 and 1751.
Secondly, the period of French ascendency, hostility
toward the English, and war on the frontiers; for this
epoch we publish four documents, ranging from 1754 to
1757. The third period, after the downfall of Canada,
is concerned with the surrender of the French posts, and
the renewed hostility of the Indians; the two journals we
publish for this period present interesting material for
the study of Western history. Each deals with a
pioneer voyage, for Rogers and Croghan were the first
Englishmen (except wandering traders or prisoners) to
penetrate the Lake Erie region and reach Detroit. The
voyage down the Ohio (1765), with its circumstantial
account of the appearance of the country, and its description
of Indian conditions and relations, is noteworthy.</p>

<p>Croghan was a voluminous writer. In addition to
the official reports of his journeys, he evidently had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the habit of noting down the events of the day in a simple,
straightforward manner, so that many manuscripts of
his were long extant, presenting often different versions
of the same journey. The earlier antiquaries published
these as chance brought them to their notice.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
official reports themselves were preserved in the colonial
archives, and are published in the Pennsylvania and New
York collections. It is believed that this is the first attempt
to bring together a selection of Croghan material that in
any adequate manner outlines his interesting career.
The chronological extent of these journals (from 1750-1765)
makes those which follow—Post’s of 1758; and
Morris’s of 1764—interludes in the events which Croghan
describes, thus throwing additional light upon the
same period and the same range of territory.</p>

have had so little Regard to his Message that they have
not thought it worth while to send him an answer as yet.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
We have seen but very few of the Chiefs of the Indians
they being all out a hunting, but those we have seen are of
opinion that their Brothers the English ought <i>to have
a Fort on this River</i> to secure the Trade, for they think
it will be dangerous for the Traders to travel the Roads
for fear of being surprised by some of the French and
French Indians, as they expect nothing else but a War
with the French next Spring. At a Town about three
hundred miles down this River, where the Chief of the
Shawonese live,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a Party of French and French Indians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
surprised some of the Shawonese and killed a man and
took a woman and two children Prisoners; the Shawonese
pursued them and took five French Men and some
Indians Prisoners; the Twightwees likewise have sent
word to the French that if they can find any of their People,
either French or French Indians, on their hunting
Ground, that they will make them Prisoners, so I expect
nothing else but a War this Spring; the Twightwees want
to settle themselves some where up this River in order
to be nearer their Brothers the English, for they are
determined never to hold a Treaty of Peace with the
French. Mr. Montour and I intend as soon as we can
get the Chiefs of the Six Nations that are Settled here
together, to sollicit them to appoint a Piece of Ground
up this River to seat the Twightwees on and kindle a
Fire for them, and if possible to remove the Shawonese
up the River, which we think will be securing those
Nations more steady to the English Interest. I hope the
Present of Goods that is preparing for those Indians
will be at this Town some time in March next, for the
Indians, as they are now acquainted that there is a Present
coming, will be impatient to receive it, as they intend to
meet the French next Spring between this and Fort De
Troit, for they are certain the French intend an Expedition
against them next Spring from Fort De Troit.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
I hear the Owendaets [Wyandots] are as steady and well
attached to the English Interest as ever they were, so
that I believe the French will make but a poor hand of
those Indians. Mr. Montour takes a great deal of Pains
to promote the English Interest amongst those Indians,
and has a great sway amongst all those Nations; if your
Honour has any Instructions to send to Mr. Montour,
Mr. Trent will forward it to me.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> I will see it delivered
to the Indians in the best manner, that your Honour’s
Commands may have their full Force with the Indians.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Proceedings of George Croghan, Esquire, and Mr.
Andrew Montour at Ohio, in the Execution of
the Governor’s Instructions to Deliver the
Provincial Present to the several Tribes of
Indians settled there</span>:<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></h4>

<p>May the 18th, 1751.—I arrived at the Log’s Town on
Ohio with the Provincial Present from the Province of
Pennsylvania, where I was received by a great number
of the Six Nations, Delawares, and Shawonese, in a very
complaisant manner in their way, by firing Guns and
Hoisting the English Colours. As soon as I came to the
shore their Chiefs met me and took me by the Hand
bidding me welcome to their Country.</p>

<p>May the 19th.—One of the Six Nation Kings from the
Head of Ohio came to the Logstown to the Council, he
immediately came to visit me, and told me he was glad to
see a Messenger from his Brother Onas on the waters of
the Ohio.</p>

<p>May the 20th.—Forty Warriors of the Six Nations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
came to Town from the Heads of Ohio, with Mr. Ioncoeur
and one Frenchman more in company.</p>

<p>May the 21st, 1751.—Mr. Ioncoeur, the French Interpreter,
called a council with all the Indians then present
in the Town, and made the following Speech:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Children</span>: I desire you may now give me an answer
from your hearts to the Speech Monsieur Celeron (the
Commander of the Party of Two Hundred Frenchmen
that went down the River two Years ago) made to you.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
His Speech was, That their Father the Governor of
Canada desired his Children on Ohio to turn away the
English Traders from amongst them, and discharge
them from ever coming to trade there again, or on any
of the Branches, on Pain of incurring his Displeasure, and
to enforce that Speech he gave them a very large Belt of
Wampum. Immediately one of the Chiefs of the Six
Nations get up and made the following answer:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Fathers</span>: I mean you that call yourselves our
Fathers, hear what I am going to say to you. You desire
we may turn our Brothers the English away, and not
suffer them to come and trade with us again; I now tell
you from our Hearts we will not, for we ourselves brought
them here to trade with us, and they shall live amongst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
us as long as there is one of us alive. You are always
threatning our Brothers what you will do to them, and
in particular to that man (pointing to me); now if you
have anything to say to our Brothers tell it to him if you
be a man, as you Frenchmen always say you are, and the
Head of all Nations. Our Brothers are the People we
will trade with, and not you. Go and tell your Governor
to ask the Onondago Council If I don’t speak the minds
of all the Six Nations;”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and then [he] returned the Belt.</p>

<p>I paid Cochawitchake the old Shawonese King a visit,
as he was rendered incapable of attending the Council
by his great age, and let him know that his Brother the
Governor of Pennsylvania was glad to hear that he was
still alive and retained his senses, and had ordered me to
cloathe him and to acquaint him that he had not forgot
his strict Attachment to the English Interest. I gave
him a Strowd Shirt, Match Coat, and a pair of Stockings,
for which he gave the Governor a great many thanks.</p>

<p>May the 22d.—A number of about forty of the Six
Nations came up the River Ohio to Logstown to wait on
the Council; as soon as they came to Town they came to
my House, and after shaking Hands they told me they
were glad to see me safe arrived in their Country after my
long Journey.</p>

<p>May the 23d.—Conajarca, one of the Chiefs of the
Six Nations, and a Party with him from the Cuscuskie,
came to Town to wait on the Council, and congratulated
me upon my safe arrival in their Country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>May the 24th.—Some Warriors of the Delawares came
to Town from the Lower Shawonese Town, and brought
a Scalp with them; they brought an Account that the
Southward Indians had come to the Lower Towns to
War, and had killed some of the Shawonese, Delawares,
and the Six Nations, so that we might not expect any
People from there to the Council.</p>

<p>May the 25th.—I had a conference with Monsieur
Ioncoeur; he desired I would excuse him and not think
hard of him for the Speech he made to the Indians requesting
them to turn the English Traders away and not
suffer them to trade, for it was the Governor of Canada’s
Orders<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to him, and he was obliged to obey them altho’
he was very sensible which way the Indians would receive
them, for he was sure the French could not accomplish
their designs with the Six Nations without it could
be done by Force, which he said he believed they would
find to be as difficult as the method they had just tryed,
and would meet with the like success.</p>

<p>May the 26th.—A Dunkar from the Colony of Virginia
came to the Log’s Town and requested Liberty of the
Six Nation Chiefs to make [a settlement] on the River
Yogh-yo-gaine a branch of Ohio, to which the Indians
made answer that it was not in their Power to dispose of
Lands; that he must apply to the Council at Onondago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
and further told him that he did not take a right method,
for he should be first recommended by their Brother the
Governor of Pennsylvania, with whom all Publick Business
of that sort must be transacted before he need expect to
succeed.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>May the 27th.—Mr Montour and I had a Conference
with the Chiefs of the Six Nations, when it was agreed
upon that the following Speeches should be made to the
Delawares, Shawonese, Owendatts and Twightwees,
when the Provincial Present should be delivered them in
the Name of the Honourable James Hamilton, Esquire,
Lieutenant Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the
Province of Pennsylvania, and Counties of New Castle,
Kent, and Sussex, on Delaware, in Conjunction with the
Chiefs of the Six United Nations On Ohio:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Treaty with the Indians of the Six Nations, Delawares,
Shawonese, Owendatts and Twightwees.</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">In the Log’s Town on Ohio</span>,<br>
Thursday the 28th May, 1751.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Present</span>:</p>

<p>Thomas Kinton, Samuel Cuzzens, Jacob Pyatt, John Owens, Thomas Ward,
Joseph Nelson, James Brown, Dennis Sullavan, Paul Pearce, Caleb Lamb, Indian Traders.</p>

<p>The Deputies of the Six Nations, Delawares, Shawonese,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Owendatts, and Twightwees; Mr. Andrew Montour,
Interpreter for the Province of Pennsylvania;
Toanshiscoe, Interpreter for the Six Nations.</p>

<p>George Croghan made the following Speech to the
several Nations, when they were met in Council, in the
Name of the Honourable James Hamilton, Esquire,
Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Friends and Brethren</span>:—I am sent here by your
Brother the Governor of Pennsylvania with this Present
of Goods to renew the Friendship so long subsisting
between Us, and I present you these four strings of Wampum
to clear your Minds and open your Eyes and Ears
that you may see the Sun clear, and hear what your
Brother is going to say to you.”—Gave 4 Strings of
Wampum.</p>

<p>A Speech delivered the Delawares—in answer to the
Speech they sent by Mr. Weiser three Years ago to his
Honour the Governor to acquaint him of the Death of
their Chief, King Oulamopess<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—by George Croghan:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brethren the Delawares</span>:—Three years ago
some of the Chiefs of your Nation sent me a Message by
Mr. Weiser to acquaint me of the Death of your King, a
man well beloved by his Brethren the English. You told
Mr. Weiser that you intended to visit me in order to
consult about a new Chief, but you never did it. I have
ever since condoled with you for the Loss of so good a
Man, and considering the lamentable Condition you were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
in for want of a Chief I present You this Belt of Wampum
and this Present to wipe away your Tears, and I desire
you may choose amongst Yourselves one of your wisest
Counsellors and present to your Brethren the Six Nations
and me for a Chief, and he so chosen by you shall be
looked upon by us as your King, with whom Publick
Business shall be transacted. Brethren, to enforce this
on your Minds I present you this Belt of Wampum.”—Gave
a Belt of Wampum, which was received with the
Yohah.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>A Speech delivered the Shawonese from the Honourable
James Hamilton, Governor of Pennsylvania, by
George Croghan:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brethren the Shawonese</span>:—Three years ago
when some of your Chiefs and some Chiefs of the Six
Nations came down to Lancaster with our Brethren the
Twightwees, they informed me that your People that
went away with Peter Chartier was coming back, and
since that I hear that Part of them are returned. I am
glad to hear that they are coming home to you again that
you may become once more a People, and not as you were
dispersed thro’ the World. I do not blame you for what
happened, for the wisest of People sometimes make mistakes;
it was the French that the Indians call their Fathers
that deceived You and scattered you about the Woods
that they might have it in their Power to keep you poor.
Brethren, I assure you by this Present that I am fully
reconcil’d and have forgot any thing that you have done,
and I hope for the future there will be a more free and
open Correspondence between us; and now your Brethren<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
the Six Nations join with me to remove any misunderstanding
that should have happened between us, that
we may henceforth spend the remainder of our days
together in Brotherly Love and Friendship. Now, that
this Speech which your Brothers the Six Nations joyn
with me in may have its full Force on your minds, I
present you this Belt of Wampum.”—Gave a Belt of
Wampum, which was received with the Yo-hah.</p>

<p>A Speech delivered the Owendatts, from the Honourable
James Hamilton, Governor of Pennsylvania, by
George Croghan:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brethren the Owendatts</span>:—I receiv’d a Message
by the Six Nations and another by Mr. Montour from
you, by both which I understand the French, whom the
Indians call their Father, wont let you rest in your Towns
in Peace, but constantly threaten to cut you off. How
comes this? Are you not a free and independent People,
and have you not a Right to live where you please on your
own Land and trade with whom you please? Your
Brethren, the English, always considered you as a free
Nation, and I think the French who attempt to infringe
on your Liberties should be opposed by one and all the
Indians or any other Nations that should undertake such
unjust proceedings.</p>

<p>“Brethren: I am sorry to hear of your Troubles, and
I hope you and your Brethren the Six Nations will let
the French know that you are a free People and will not
be imposed on by them. To assure you that I have
your Troubles much at heart I present you this Belt
and this Present of Goods to cloathe your Families.”—Gave
a Belt of Wampum, which was received with the
Yo-hah.</p>

<p>A Speech delivered the Twightwees from the Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
James Hamilton, Esquire, Governor Pennsylvania,
by George Croghan:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brethren the Twightwees</span>:—As you are an
antient and renowned Nation I was well pleased when
you sent your Deputies now three years ago to sollicit
our Alliance; nor did we hesitate to grant you your
Request, as it came so warmly recommended to us by
our Brethren the Six Nations, Delawares, and Shawonese.
At your further Request we ordered our Traders to go
amongst you and supply you with Goods at as reasonable
rates as they could afford. We understand that in obedience
to our Commands our Traders have given you full
Satisfaction to your Requests. In one your Towns about
three Months ago Mr. George Croghan likewise informs
us that some more of your Tribes earnestly requested
to become our Allies. He and Mr. Montour did receive
a writing from you Certifying such your Request, and
containing your Promises of Fidelity and Friendship,
which we have seen and approve of. Brethren: we have
recommended it to our Brethren the Six Nations to give
you their advice how you should behave in your new
Alliance with us, and we expect that you will follow it,
that the Friendship now subsisting between Us, the Six
Nations, Delawares, Shawonese, Owendatts, and you,
may become as Strong as a great Mountain which the
Winds constantly blow against but never overset. Brethren,
to assure you of our hearty Inclinations towards you
I make you this Present of Goods; and that this Speech
which I make you now in Conjunction with the Six
Nations may have its full Force on your minds, I present
you this Belt of Wampum.”—Gave a Belt, which was
received with the Yo-hah.</p>

<p>A Speech made to the Six United Nations by George<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Croghan in behalf of the Honourable James Hamilton,
Esquire, Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brethren the Six Nations</span>: Hear what I am
going to say to you. Brethren: it is a great while since
we, your Brothers the English, first came over the great
Water (meaning the Sea); as soon as our ship struck the
Land you the Six Nations took hold of her and tyed her
to the Bushes, and for fear the Bushes would not be
strong enough to hold her you removed the Rope and
tyed it about a great Tree; then fearing the winds would
blow the Tree down, you removed the Rope and tyed it
about a great Mountain in the Country (meaning the
Onondago Country), and since that time we have lived
in true Brotherly Love and Friendship together. Now,
Brethren, since that there are several Nations joined in
Friendship with you and Us, and of late our Brethren
the Twightwees: Now, Brethren, as you are the Head of
all the Nations of Indians, I warmly recommend it to
you to give our Brethren the Twightwees your best advice
that they may know how to behave in their New
Alliance, and likewise I give our Brethren the Owendatts
in charge to you, that you may Strengthen them to withstand
their Enemies the French, who I understand treat
them more like Enemies than Children tho’ they call
themselves their Father.</p>

<p>“Brethren: I hope we, your Brothers the English,
and you the Six Nations, Delawares, Shawonese, Owendatts,
and Twightwees, will continue in such Brotherly
Love and Friendship that it will be as strong as that
Mountain to which you tyed our Ship. Now, Brethren,
I am informed by George Croghan that the French
obstruct my Traders and carry away their Persons and
Goods, and are guilty of many outrageous Practices,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Whereby the Roads are rendered unsafe to travel in,
nor can we ask our Traders to go amongst you whilst
their Lives and Effects are in such great Danger. How
comes this to pass? Don’t this proceed from the Pride
of Onontio, whom the Indians call their Father, because
they don’t see his ill Designs? The strong houses you
gave him Leave to erect on your Lands serve (As your
Brethren the English always told you) to impoverish
You and keep your Wives and Children always naked
by keeping the English Traders at a Distance, the French
well knowing the English sell their Goods cheaper than
they can afford, and I can assure You Onontio will never
rest while an English Trader comes to Ohio; and indeed
if you don’t open your Eyes and put a Stop to his Proceedings
he will gain his Ends. Brethren: I hope you
will consider well what Onontio means or is about to do.
To enforce what I have been saying to you on your minds,
I present this Belt of Wampum.”—Gave a Belt. They
received this Belt with Yo-hah.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the Six Nations made the following
Speech to Monsieur Ioncoeur in open Council; he spoke
very quick and sharp with the Air of a Warrior:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Father</span>—How comes it that you have broke the
General Peace? Is it not three years since you as well as
our Brother the English told Us that there was a Peace
between the English and French, and how comes it that
you have taken our Brothers as your Prisoners on our
Lands? Is it not our Land (Stamping on the Ground and
putting his Finger to John Coeur’s Nose)? What Right
has Onontio to our Lands? I desire you may go home
directly off our Lands and tell Onontio to send us word
immediately what was his Reason for using our Brothers
so, or what he means by such Proceedings, that we may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
know what to do, for I can assure Onontio that We the
Six Nations will not take such Usage. You hear what
I say, and that is the Sentiments of all our Nations; tell
it to Onontio that that is what the Six Nations said to
you.”—Gave 4 Strings of black Wampum.</p>

<p>After which the Chief of the Indians ordered the Goods
to be divided, and appointed some of each Nation to
stand by to see it done, that those that were absent might
have a sufficient Share laid by for them.</p>

<p>After which the Chiefs made me a Speech and told me
it was a Custom with their Brothers whenever they went
to Council to have their Guns, Kettles, and Hatchets
mended, and desired I might order that done, for they
could not go home till they had that done. So Mr. Montour
and I agreed to comply with their Request, and
ordered it done that they might depart well satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May it please your Honour</span>: Inclosed is a Copy of
the Treaty held on Ohio by your Honour’s Instructions
on delivering your Honour’s Present to the several Nations
of Indians Residing there. I hope your Honour on perusing
the Proceedings of the Treaty will find that I have
observed your Honour’s Instructions in every Speech
that I delivered from your Honour. I took all the
Pains I could to make the Present have its full Force
and Weight with the Indians, and I have the Pleasure of
assuring your Honour that the Indians were all unanimously
well pleased at your Honour’s Speeches, and
likewise acknowledged it was a great Present, and the
Chiefs of the Six Nations took great Pains with me in
dividing it amongst the other nations, that it might have
its full force with them, which I assure your Honour it
had, for every man I saw there was well satisfied with
his share of the Present; the Indians in general expressed
a high Satisfaction at having the Opportunity in the
Presence of Ioncœur of expressing their hearty Love
and Inclinations towards the English, and likewise to
assure your Honour what Contempt they had for the
French, which your Honour will see by the Speeches they
made. Ioncœur-Ioncœur has sent a Letter to your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Honour, which I enclose here.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Mr. Montour has
exerted himself very much on this occasion, and he is not
only very capable of doing the Business, but look’d on
amongst all the Indians as one of their Chiefs, I hope your
Honour will think him worth notice, and recommend it
to the Assembly to make him full Satisfaction for his
Trouble, as he has employed all his Time in the Business
of the Government. I hope your Honour will recommend
it to the Government of Virginia to answer the
Speech sent them now in answer to their own Speech
sent last Fall, as soon as possible. May it please your
Honour, I make bold to send down my Account against
the Province for what Wampum I delivered Mr. Montour
to make the Speeches last Fall and this Spring, delivered
by your Honour’s Instructions. Mr. Montour is
at my House and will wait on your Honour when you
Please to appoint the time. I hope what has been transacted
at this Treaty will be pleasing to your Honour, as
I am sure the Present had its full Force, and shall defer
any farther Account till you have the opportunity of
examining Mr. Montour.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Croghan’s Journal</span>, 1754.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></h4>

<p>January 12th, 1754.—I arrived at Turtle Creek about
eight miles from the Forks of Mohongialo, where I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
informed by John Frazier, an Indian Trader,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that Mr.
Washington, who was sent by the Governor of Virginia
to the French Camp, was returned. Mr. Washington
told Mr. Frazier that he had been very well used by the
French General; that after he delivered his Message the
General told him his Orders were to take all the English
he found on the Ohio, which Orders he was determined
to obey, and further told him that the English had no
business to trade on the Ohio, for that all the Lands of
Ohio belonged to his Master the King of France, all
to Alegainay Mountain. Mr. Washington told Mr.
Frazier the Fort where he was is very strong, and that
they had Abundance of Provisions, but they would not
let him see their Magazine; there are about one hundred
Soldiers and fifty Workmen at that Fort, and as many
more at the Upper Fort, and about fifty Men at Weningo
with Jean Coeur; the Rest of their Army went home last
Fall, but is to return as soon as possible this Spring;
when they return they are to come down to Log’s Town
in order to build a Fort somewhere thereabouts. This
is all I had of Mr. Washington’s Journey worth relating
to your Honour.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>On the thirteenth I arrived at Shanoppin’s Town,
where Mr. Montour and Mr. Patten overtook me.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>On the fourteenth we set off to Log’s Town, where we
found the Indians all drunk; the first Salutation we got
was from one of the Shawonese who told Mr. Montour
and myself we were Prisoners, before we had time to
tell them that their Men that were in Prison at Carolina
were released, and that we had two of them in our Company.
The Shawonese have been very uneasy about
those Men that were in Prison, and had not those Men
been released it might have been of very ill consequence at
this time; but as soon as they found their Men were
released they seem’d all overjoyed, and I believe will
prove true to their Alliance.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>On the fifteenth Five Canoes of French came down to
Log’s Town in Company with the Half King<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and some
more of the Six Nations, in Number an Ensign, a Serjeant,
and Fifteen Soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>On the sixteenth in the morning Mr. Patten took a
Walk to where the French had pitched their Tents, and
on his returning back by the Officer’s Tent he ordered
Mr. Patten to be brought in to him, on which Word came
to the Town that Mr. Patten was taken Prisoner. Mr.
Montour and myself immediately went to where the
French was encamped, where we found the French
Officer and the Half King in a high Dispute. The
Officer told Mr. Montour and Me that he meant no hurt
to Mr. Patten, but wondered he should pass backward
and forward without calling in. The Indians were all
drunk, and seemed very uneasy at the French for stopping
Mr. Patten, on which the Officer ordered his Men
on board their Canoes and set off to a small Town of
the Six Nations about two Miles below the Log’s Town,
where he intends to stay till the Rest of their Army
come down. As to any particulars that pass’d between
the Officer and Mr. Patten I refer your Honour to Mr.
Patten.</p>

<p>By a Chickisaw Man who has lived amongst the Shawonese
since he was a Lad, and is just returned from the
Chickisaw Country<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> where he has been making a Visit to
his Friends, we hear that there is a large Body of French
at the Falls of Ohio, not less he says than a thousand Men;
that they have abundance of Provisions and Powder and
Lead with them, and that they are coming up the River
to meet the Army from Canada coming down. He says
a Canoe with Ten French Men in her came up to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Lower Shawonese Town with him, but on some of the
English Traders’ threatning to take them they set back
that night without telling their Business.</p>

<p>By a message sent here from Fort De Troit by the
Owendats to the Six Nations, Delawares, and Shawonese,
we hear that the Ottoways are gathering together on this
Side Lake Erie, several hundreds of them, in order to
cutt off the Shawonese at the Lower Shawonese Town.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
The French and Ottoways offered the Hatchet to the
Owendats but they refused to assist them.</p>

<p>We hear from Scarrooyady that the Twightwees that
went last Spring to Canada to counsel with the French
were returned last Fall; that they had taken hold of the
French Hatchet and were entirely gone back to their old
Towns amongst the French.</p>

<p>From the sixteenth to the twenty-sixth we could do
nothing, the Indians being constantly drunk.</p>

<p>On the twenty sixth the French called the Indians to
Council and made them a Present of Goods. On the
Indians Return the Half King told Mr. Montour and me
he would take an Opportunity to repeat over to Us what
the French said to them.</p>

<p>On the twenty-seventh We called the Indians to Council,
and cloathed the Two Shawonese according to the
Indian Custom, and delivered them up in Council with
your Honour’s Speeches, sent by Mr. Patten, which Mr.
Montour adapted to Indian Forms as much as was in his
Power or mine.</p>

<p>On the twenty-eighth We called the Indians to Council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
again, and delivered them a large Belt of Black and White
Wampum in Your Honour’s and the Governor of Virginia’s
Name, by which we desired they might open
their Minds to your Honour, and speak from their Hearts
and not from their Lips; and that they might now inform
your Honour by Mr. Andrew Montour, whom You had
chosen to transact Business between You and your
Brethren at Ohio, whether that Speech which they sent
your Honour by Lewis Montour was agreed on in Council
or not, and assured them they might freely open their
Minds to their Brethren your Honour and the Governor
of Virginia, as the only Friends and Brethren they had
to depend on. Gave the Belt.</p>

<p>After delivering the Belt Mr. Montour gave them the
Goods left in my Care by your Honour’s Commissioners
at Carlisle, and at the same time made a Speech to them
to let them know that those Goods were for the Use of
their Warriors and Defence of their Country.</p>

<p>As soon as the Goods were delivered the Half King
made a Speech to the Shawonese and Delawares, and
told them as their Brother Onas had sent them a large
Supply of Necessaries for the Defence of their Country,
that he would put it in their Care till all their Warriors
would have Occasion to call for it, as their Brethren the
English had not yet got a strong House to keep such
Things safe in.</p>

<p>The Thirty-First A Speech delivered by the Half King
in Answer to your Honour’s Speeches on delivering the
Shawonese:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brother Onas</span>:—We return You our hearty Thanks
for the Trouble You have taken in sending for our poor
Relations the Shawonese, and with these four Strings
of Wampum we clear your Eyes and Hearts, that You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
may see your Brothers the Shawonese clear as You used
to do, and not think that any small Disturbance shall
obstruct the Friendship so long subsisting between You
and us your Brethren, the Six Nations, Delawares, and
Shawonese. We will make all Nations that are in Alliance
with Us acquainted with the Care You have had of
our People at such a great distance from both You and
Us.”—Gave Four Strings of Wampum.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A Speech Delivered by the Half King</i></p>

<p>“Brethren the Governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia:
You desire Us to open our Minds to You and to
speak from our Hearts, which we assure You, Brethren, we
do. You desire We may inform you whether that Speech
sent by Lewis Montour was agreed on in Council or not,
Which we now assure You it was in part; but that Part
of giving the Lands to pay the Traders’ Debts We know
nothing of it; it must have been added by the Traders
that wrote the Letter;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but we earnestly requested by
that Belt, and likewise we now request that our Brother
the Governor of Virginia may build a Strong House at
the Forks of the Mohongialo, and send some of our young
Brethren, their Warriors, to live on it; and we expect
our Brother of Pennsylvania will build another House
somewhere on the River where he shall think proper,
where whatever assistance he will think proper to send<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
us may be kept safe for us, as our Enemies are just at
hand, and we do not know what Day they may come
upon Us. We now acquaint our Brethren that we have
our Hatchet in our Hands to strike the Enemy as soon as
our Brethren come to our assistance.”</p>

<p>Gave a Belt and Eight Strings of Wampum.</p>

<p>After the Chiefs had signed the last Speech, the Half
King repeated over the French Council, which was as
follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Children</span>: I am come here to tell you that your
Father is coming here to visit you and to take You under
his care, and I desire You may not listen to any ill News
You hear, for I assure you he will not hurt You; ’Tis true
he has something to say to your Brethren the English,
but do you sit still and do not mind what your Father does
to your Brothers, for he will not suffer the English to
live or tread on this River Ohio;”—on which he made
them a Present of Goods.</p>

<p>February the First.—By a Cousin of Mr. Montour’s
that came to Log’s town in company with a Frenchman
from Weningo by Land, we hear that the French expect
Four Hundred Men every Day to the Fort above Weningo,
and as soon as they come they are to come down the
River to Log’s town to take possession from the English
till the rest of the Army comes in the Spring.</p>

<p>The Frenchman that came here in company with Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Montour’s Cousin, is Keeper of the King’s Stores, and I
believe the chief of his Business is to take a view of the
Country and to see what Number of English there is
here, and to know how the Indians are affected to the
French.</p>

<p>February the Second.—Just as we were leaving the
Log’s Town, the Indians made the following Speech:</p>

<p>“Brethren the Governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia:
we have opened our Hearts to You and let you
know our Minds; we now, by these two Strings of black
Wampum, desire You may directly send to our Assistance
that You and We may secure the Lands of Ohio, for there
is nobody but You our Brethren and ourselves have any
Right to the Lands; but if you do not send immediately
we shall surely be cut of[f] by our Enemy the French.”—Gave
two Strings of black Wampum.</p>

King of the Delawares.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brother Onas</span>: I am glad to hear all our People
here are of one mind; it is true I live here on the River
Side, which is the French Road, and I assure you by

up, but I will move nearer to my Brethren the English,
where I can keep our Women and Children safe from the
Enemy.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>—Gave Three Strings of Wampum.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Aughwick</span>, October 9th, 1755.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: On my return home I met with an Indian
from Ohio who gives me the following accounts: That
about 14 days ago he left Ohio, at that time there was
about 160 Men ready to set out to harrass the English
which probably they be those doing the Mischiefs on
Potomack. He says the French Fort is not very strong
with men at present. He likewise says that he is of
opinion the Indians will do no mischief on the Inhabitants
of Pennsylvania till they can draw all the Indians
out of the Province and off Sasquehanna, which they are
now industriously endeavouring to do; and he desires me
as soon as I see the Indians remove from Sasquehanna
back to Ohio to shift my quarters, for he says that the
French will, if possible, lay all the back frontiers in ruins
this Winter.</p>

<p>This man was sent by a few of my old Indian Friends
to give me this caution, that I might save my scalps,
which he says would be no small Prize to the French;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and he has ordered me to keep it private so that I don’t
intend to communicate it to any body but you. I don’t
know whether the Governor should be made acquainted
with it or no; but if you judge it proper write the Governor
the whole, but at the same time request him to keep
it a secret from whom he had his Information, for if it
should be made publick to the Interpreters or Indians it
may cost me and the man I had my Information from
our Lives; and, moreover, the best method to frustrate
their Designs will be for the Governor not to let the Indians
know that he is acquainted with their design, but to
conduct the affair privately, so as not to let the Indians
know he has any suspicion of them. Indeed it is only
what I thought the Indians always aimed at, and what
I feared they would accomplish, for I see all our great
Directors of Indian affairs are very short sighted, and
glad I am that I have no hand in Indian affairs at this critical
time, where no fault can be thrown on my shoulders.</p>

</ul>

<p>Mr. Croghan having been desired by the Governor in
December last to do all in his Power to gain Intelligence
of the Motions and Designs of the Indians, and being
now in Town was sent for into Council, and at the Instance
of the Governor gave the following Information,
viz: “That he sent Delaware Jo, one of our Friendly
Indians, to the Ohio for Intelligence, who returned to his
House at Aucquick the eighth Instant, and informed
him that he went to Kittannin, an Indian Delaware Town
on the Ohio about forty Miles above Fort Duquesne, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Residence of Chingas and Captain Jacobs, where he found
one hundred and forty Men chiefly Delawares and Shawonese,
who had then with them above one hundred English
Prisoners big and little taken from Virginia and
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>That there the Beaver,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Brother of Chingas, told him
that the Governor of Fort Duquesne<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> had often offered
the French Hatchet to the Shawonese and Delawares,
who had as often refused it, declaring they would do as
they should be advised by the Six Nations; but that in
April or May last a Party of Six Nation Warriors in
Company with some Caghnawagos<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and Adirondacks
called at the French Fort in their going to War against the
Southern Indians, and on these the Governor of Fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Duquesne prevailed to offer the French Hatchet to the
Delawares and Shawonese who received it from them
and went directly against Virginia.</p>

<p>That neither the Beaver nor several others of the Shawonese
and Delawares approved of this measure nor had
taken up the Hatchet, and the Beaver believed some of
those who had were sorry for what they had done, and
would be glad to make up Matters with the English.</p>

<p>That from Kittannin he went to the Log’s Town, where
he found about one hundred Indians and thirty English
Prisoners taken by the Shawonese living at the Lower
Shawonese Town from the western Frontier of Virginia
and sent up to Log’s Town. He was told the same thing
by these Shawonese that the Beaver had told him before
respecting their striking the English by the advise of some
of the Six Nations, and further he was informed that the
French had sollicited the Indians to sell them the English
Prisoners, which they had refused, declaring they would
not dispose of them, but keep them until they should
receive Advice from the Six Nations what to do with them.</p>

<p>That there are more or less of the Six Nations living
with the Shawonese and Delawares in their Towns, and
these always accompanied them in their Incursions upon
the English and took Part with them in the War.</p>

<p>That when at Log’s Town, which is near Fort Duquesne,
on the opposite Side of the River, he intended to have
gone there to see what the French were doing in that
Fort, but could not cross the River for the driving of the
Ice; he was, however, informed the Number of the French
did not exceed four hundred.</p>

<p>That he returned to Kittannin, and there learned that
Ten Delawares were gone to the Sasquehannah, and as
he supposed to persuade those Indians to strike the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
who might perhaps be concerned in the Mischief
lately done in the County of Northampton.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>No more than Seven Indians being as yet come to
Carlisle Mr. Croghan was asked the Reason of it; he said
that the Indians were mostly gone an hunting, but he
expected as many more at least would come in a day or
two.</p>

<p>Mr. Weiser was then sent for and it was taken into
Consideration what should be said to the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Croghan’s Transactions with the Indians Previous
to Hostilities on the Ohio</span><a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></h4>

<p>In November 1748 Mʳ Hamilton arrived in Philadelphia,
Governor of Pennsylvania. During the late war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
all the Indian tribes living on the Ohio and the branches
thereof, on this side Lake Erie, were in strict friendship
with the English in the several Provinces, and took the
greatest care to preserve the friendship then subsisting
between them and us. At that time we carried on a
considerable branch of trade with those Indians for
skins and furrs, no less advantagious to them than to us.
We sold them goods on much better terms than the French,
which drew many Indians over the Lakes to trade with
us. The exports of skins and furs from this Province at
that time will shew the increase of our trade in them
articles.</p>

<p>In August 1749, Governor Hamilton sent me to the
Ohio with a message to the Indians, to notifie to them
the Cessation of Arms, and to enquire of the Indians the
reason of the march of Monsieur Celaroon with two
hundred French soldiers through their country (This
detachment under Monsieur Celaroon had passed by
the Logs Town before I reached it.)</p>

<p>After I had delivered my message to the Indians, I
inquired what the French Commander said to them.
They told me he said he was only come to visit them,
and see how they were cloathed, for their Father the
Governor of Canada was determined to take great care
of all his children settled on the Ohio, and desired they
wou’d turn away all the English traders from amongst
them, for their Father would not suffer them to trade
there any more, but would send traders of his own, who
would trade with them on reasonabler terms than the
English.</p>

<p>I then asked them if they really thought that was the
intention of the French coming at that time: They answered,
yes, they believed the French not only wanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
to drive the English traders off, that they might have the
trade to themselves; but that they had also a further
intention by their burrying iron plates with inscriptions
on them in the mouth of every remarkable Creek, which
we know is to steal our country from us. But we will
go to the Onondago Council and consult them how we
may prevent them from defrauding us of our land.</p>

<p>At my return I acquainted the Governor what passed
between the Indians and me.</p>

<p>This year the Governor purchased a tract of land on
the East of Susquehannah for the Proprietaries, at which
time the Indians complained that the White People was
encroaching on their lands on the West side of Susquehannah,
and desired that the Governor might turn them
off, as those lands were the hunting-grounds of the Susquehannah
Indians.</p>

<p>At that time the Six Nations delivered a string of Wampum
from the Connays, desiring their Brother Onas to
make the Connays some satisfaction for their settlement
at the Connay Town in Donegal,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> which they had lately
left and settled amongst the Susquehannah Indians which
town had been reserved for their use at that time their
Brother Onas had made a purchase of the land adjoining
to that town.</p>

<p>In November [1750] I went to the country of the
Twightwees by order of the Governor with a small
present to renew the chain of friendship, in company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
with Mʳ Montour Interpreter; on our journey we met Mʳ
Gist, a messenger from the Governor of Virginia, who
was sent to invite the Ohio Indians to meet the Commissioners
of Virginia at the Logs town in the Spring
following to receive a present of goods which their father
the King of Great Britain had sent them.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Whilst I
was at the Twightwee town delivering the present and
message, there came several of the Chiefs of the Wawioughtanes
and Pianguisha Nations, living on Wabash,
and requested to be admitted into the chain of friendship
between the English and the Six Nations and their allies;
which request I granted &amp; exchang’d deeds of friendship
with them, with a view of extending His Majesty’s
Indian interest, and made them a small present. On
my return I sent a coppy of my proceedings to the Governor.
On his laying it before the House of Assembly, it
was rejected and myself condemned for bad conduct in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
drawing an additionall expence on the Government, and
the Indians were neglected.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>At the time that the Secretary, the provincial Interpreter,
with the Justice of Cumberland County and the
Sheriff were ordered to dispossess the people settled on
the unpurchased lands on the West side of Susquehannah,
and on their return to my house, they met a deputation
of the Ohio Indians, who told the Secretary that they had
heard of a purchase that the Governor had made on the
East side of Susquehannah, and said they were intitled
to part of the goods paid for that purchase, but had received
none, that they were come now to desire the
Governor to purchase no more lands without first acquainting
them, for that the lands belonged to them as
well as to the Onondago Council; on which they delivered
a Belt of Wampum, and desired that the Governor might
send that Belt to Onondago to let them know that the
Ohio Indians had made such a complaint.</p>

<p>In April 1751 the Governor sent me to Ohio with a
present of goods; the speeches were all wrote by the
Provincial Interpreter Mʳ Wiser. In one of the speeches
was warmly expressed that the Govʳ of Pennsylvania
would build a fort on the Ohio, to protect the Indians,
as well as the English Traders, from the insults of the
French. On the Governor perusing the speech he thought
it too strongly expressed, on which he ordered me not
to make it, but ordered me to sound the Chief of the
Indians on that head, to know whether it would be agreeable
to them or not. Which orders I obeyed, and did in
the presence of Mʳ Montour sound the Half King Scarioaday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and the Belt of Wampum, who all told me that the
building of a Trading House had been agreed on between
them and the Onondago Council, since the time of the
detachment of French, under the command of Monsʳ
Celaroon, had gone down the river Ohio, and said they
would send a message by me to their Brother Onas, on
that head.</p>

<p>After I had delivered the present and done the chief
of the business, the Indians in publick Council, by a
Belt of Wampum, requested that the Governor of Pennsylvania
would immediately build a strong house (or Fort)
at the Forks of Monongehela, where the Fort Du Quesne
now stands, for the protection of themselves and the
English Traders.</p>

<p>But on my return this Government rejected the proposal
I had made, and condemned me for making such
a report to the government, alledging it was not the intention
of the Indians. The Provincial Interpreter, who
being examined by the House of Assembly, denyed that
he knew of any instructions I had to treat with the Indians
for building a Trading House, though he wrote the speech
himself, and further said he was sure the Six Nations
would never agree to have a Trading House built there,
and Governor Hamilton, though he by his letter of instructions
ordered me to sound the Indians on that head,
let the House know he had given me no such instructions:
all which instructions will appear on the Records
of Indian Affairs.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[52]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
The 12ᵗʰ June 1752, the Virginia Commissioners met
the Indians at the Logs Town and delivered the King’s
present to them. The Indians then renewed their request
of having a fort built as the government of Pennsylvania
had taken no notice of their former request to them, and
they insisted strongly on the government of Virginia’s
building one in the same place that they had requested
the Pennsylvanians to build one; but to no effect.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1753 a French army came to the heads of
Ohio and built fort Preskle on the Lake, and another
fort at the head of Venango Creek, called by the French
Le Buff Rivere.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Early in the fall the same year about
one hundred Indians from the Ohio came from Winchester
in Virginia, expecting to meet the Governor there who
did not come, but ordered Coll. Fairfax to meet them.
Here again they renewed their request of having a Fort
built, and said altho’ the French had placed themselves
on the head of Ohio, that if their Brethren the English
would exert themselves and sent out a number of men,
that they would join them, &amp; drive the French army
away or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>From Winchester those Indians came to Cumberland
County where they were met by Commissioners from
Governor Hamilton, and promised the same which they
had done in Virginia;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> but notwithstanding the earnest
solicitations of those Indians, the governments neglected
building them a fort, or assisting them with men; believing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
or seeming to believe that there was no French there;
till the Governor of Virginia sent Col. Washington to the
heads of Venango Creek, where he met the French
General at a fort he had lately built there.</p>

<p>In February 1754, Captain Trent was at the mouth
of Red Stone Creek, building a Store house for the Ohio
Company, in order to lodge stores to be carried from
there to the mouth of Monongehela, by water, where he
had received orders in conjunction with Cresap<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and
Gist to build a fort for that Company. This Creek is
about 37 miles from where fort Du Quesne now stands.</p>

<p>About the 10ᵗʰ of this month he received a Commission
from the Governor of Virginia with orders to raise a
Company of Militia, and that he would soon be joined by
Col. Washington. At this time the Indians appointed
to meet him at the mouth of Monongehela in order to
receive a present which he had brought them from Virginia.
Between this time and that appointed to meet the
Indians he raised upwards of twenty men &amp; found them
with arms ammunition &amp; provisions at his own expence.
At this meeting the Indians insisted that he should set
his men at work, which he did, and finished a Store House,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
and a large quantity of timber hew’d, boards saw’d, and
shingles made. After finishing his business with the
Indians he stayed some time in expectation of Col.
Washington joining him, as several accounts came of
his being there in a few days. As there was no more
men to be had here at this time, there being no inhabitants
in this country but Indian traders who were scattered
over the country for several hundred miles, &amp; no
provisions but a little Indian corn to be had, he applied
to the Indians, who had given him reason to believe they
would join him and cut off the French on the Ohio,
but when he proposed it to the Half-King, he told him
that had the Virginians been in earnest they wou’d have
had their men there before that time, and desired him
to get the rest of his men and hurry out the provisions.
Agreeable to his instructions he went and recruited his
company, but before he could get back, it being 110
miles from here to the nighest inhabitants, the French
came and drove his people off.</p>

<p>In June following when the Indians heard that Coll.
Washington with a Detachment of the Virginia troops
had reached the great Meadows, the Half-King and
Scaruady with about 50 men joined him—notwithstanding
the French were in possession of this country with
six or seven hundred men; so great was their regard for
the English at that time.</p>

<p>After the defeat of Col. Washington, the Indians came
to Virginia, where they stayed some time, &amp; then came
to my house in Pennsylvania and put themselves under
the protection of this Government.</p>

<p>As soon as possible they sent messengers to call down
the heads of the Delawares and Shawnese to a meeting
at my house, and at the same time they desired the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
of this Province, or some Deputy from him, to meet
them there to consult what was best to be done.</p>

<p>The Governor sent Mʳ Wiser the Provincial Interpreter;
the Chiefs of those Indians came down and met him
and offered their service, but it was not accepted by Mʳ
Wiser. He in answer told them to sit still, till Governor
Morris arrived, and then he himself wou’d come and let
them know what was to be done. They waited there till
very late in the fall, but received no answer, so set off
for their own country.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>This Government continued to maintain the Indians
that lived at my house, till the Spring, when General
Bradock<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> arrived; they then desired Governor Morris
to let me know they would not maintain them any longer;
at which time Governor Morris desired me to take them
to Fort Cumberland to meet General Bradock; which I
did;—On my arrival at Fort Cumberland General Braddock
asked me where the rest of the Indians were. I
told him I did not know, I had brought but fifty men
which was all that was at that time under my care, and
which I had brought there by the directions of Governor
Morris. He replied that Governor Dinwiddie told me
[him] at Alexandria that he had sent for 400 which would
be here before me. I answered I knew nothing of that
but that Captain Montour the Virginia Interpreter was
in camp &amp; could inform His Excellency. On which
Montour was sent for who informed the General that
Mʳ Gist’s son was sent off some time agoe for some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Cherokee Indians, but whether they would come he
could not tell. On which the General asked me whether
I could not send for some of the Delawares and Shawnese
to Ohio. I told him I could; on which I sent a messenger
to Ohio, who returned in eight days and brought with
him the Chiefs of the Delawares. The General held
a conference the Chiefs in company with those fifty I had
brought with me, and made them a handsome present, &amp;
behav’d to them as kindly as he possibly could, during
their stay, ordering me to let them want for nothing.</p>

<p>The Delawares promised, in Council, to meet the
General on the road, as he marched out with a number
of their warriors. But whether the former breaches of
faith on the side of the English prevented them, or that
they choose to see the event of the action between General
Braddock and the French, I cannot tell; but they disappointed
the General and did not meet him.</p>

<p>Two days after the Delaware Chiefs had left the camp
at Fort Cumberland, Mʳ Gist’s son returned from the
Southward, where he had been sent by Govʳ Dinwiddie,
but brought no Indians with him.</p>

<p>Soon after, the General was preparing for the march,
with no more Indians than I had with me; when Coll.
Innis<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> told the General that the women and children of
the Indians that were to remain at Fort Cumberland,
would be very troublesome, and that the General need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
not take above eight or nine men out with him, for if he
took more he would find them very troublesome on the
march and of no service; on which the General ordered
me to send back all the men, women and children, to my
house in Pennsylvania, except eight or ten, which I should
keep as scouts and to hunt; which I accordingly did.</p>

them to come and meet me.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This Evening we loaded
our Boats &amp; lay on the shore that night.</p>

<p>4ᵗʰ.—We set sail at seven o’clock in the morning &amp;
at three in the afternoon we got to Siney Sipey or Stoney
Creek about ten Leagues from Presqu’ Isle where we
went ashore in a fine Harbour and encamped.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

fire Arms, we then put ashore shook hands and smoked
with them out of their Council Pipe, we drank a dram
and then embarked, about two o’Clock arrived at Wajea
Sipery or Crooked Creek, went ashore in a good Harbour
and encamped, this day went about seven Leagues.
After we had encamped I called a meeting of all the Indians
and acquainted them of the Reduction of Montreal,
and agreeable to the Capitulation we were going to take
possession of Fort D’Troit, Misselemakinack, Fort St.
Joseph’s &amp;c. and carry the French Garrisons away
Prisoners of War &amp; Garrison the Forts with English
Troops, that the French Inhabitants were to remain in
possession of their property on their taking the Oath
of Fidelity to his Majesty King George, and assured them
by a Belt of Wampum that all Nations of Indians should
enjoy a free Trade with their Brethren the English and be
protected in peaceable possession of their hunting Country
as long as they adhered to his Majestys Interest. The
Indians in several Speeches made me, expressed their
satisfaction at exchanging their Fathers the French for
their Brethren the English who they were assured were
much better able to supply them with all necessaries,
and then begged that we might forget every thing that
happened since the commencement of the War, as they
were obliged to serve the French from whom they got all
their necessitys supplyed, that it was necessity and not
choice that made them take part with the French which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
they confirmed by several Belts and Strings of Wampum.
The principal Man of the Ottawas said on a large Belt
that he had not long to live &amp; said pointing to two Men
“those Men I have appointed to transact the Business
of my Tribe, with them you confirmed the Peace last
year when you came up to Pittsburg, I now recommend
them to you, and I beg you may take notice of them and
pity our women and Children as they are poor and naked,
you are able to do it &amp; by pitying their Necessitys you
will win their Hearts.” The Speaker then took up the
Pipe of Peace belonging to the Nation and said Brother
to Confirm what we have said to you I give you this
Peace Pipe which is known to all the Nations living in
this Country and when they see it they will know it to be
the Pipe of Peace belonging to our Nation, then [he]
delivered the Pipe.</p>

<p>The principal Man then requested some Powder &amp;
Lead for their young Men to stay there and hunt for the
support of their familys as the Chiefs had agreed to go
with us to D’Troit, and a little Flower which I applyed
to Major Rogers for who chearfully ordered it to me as I
informed him it was necessary &amp; would be for the good
of his Majestys Indian Interest.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

Hunting.</p>

<p>7ᵗʰ.—We loaded our Boats, sent of[f] the Battoes with
the Provisions and some Whale Boats to attend them,

a hunting. He informed me he was fifteen days from
D’Troit, that before he left that the French had Accounts
of the reduction of Montreal &amp; that they expected an
English Army from Niagara to D’Troit every day; that
M. Balletré,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> would not believe that the Governor of
Montreal had Capitulated for D’Troit; that he had no
more than fifty soldiers in the Fort; that the Inhabitants
and Indians who were at home were very much afraid
of being plundered by our Soldiers, and he requested
that no outrage might be committed by our soldiers on
the Indian settlements, as the chief of the Indians were
out a hunting. I assured them that there should be no
plundering. This afternoon we came to Nechey Thepy
or two Creeks,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> about Nine Leagues from Gichawga,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>

and collected the principal Men of the several Nations
together and delivered their Messages which were well
received by the Indians, and that a Deputation of the
Indians were appointed to come with my Deputys to
meet us at that place which was the Carrying place from
Sandusky into the Lake, we put into the Creek called
Crambary Creek, went a shore &amp; encamped to wait the
arrival of those Deputys; we sent over the Carrying place

&amp; they hoped their answers would be to our expectations.
After drinking a dram round we dismissed them
&amp; gave them Provisions.</p>

<p>22ᵈ.—About 9 o’Clock the Indians met in Council,
though several of their People were in Liquor, &amp; made
several speeches on strings and one Belt of Wampum all
to the following purport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: We your Brethren of the several Nations
living in this Country received your Messages well and
return you thanks for sending us word of what has happened
and your coming to remove the French Garrison
out of our Country and putting one there of our Brethren
the English; your Conduct in sending us timely notice
of it is a Confirmation of your sincerity &amp; upright intentions
towards us and we are sent here to meet you &amp; bid
you welcome to our Country.</p>

<p>Brethren all our principal Men are met on this side
the French Garrison to shake hands with you in Friendship

French Interest and receive our Brethren the English as
our true Friends &amp; establish a lasting Peace with you &amp;
we expect you will support us and supply us with a fire &amp;
open Trade for the Cloathing of our Women and Children.
Then they delivered two strings of Wampum to
the Six Nations and Delawares returning them thanks for
sending Messages to them with the Deputys I had sent
&amp; desired those strings might be delivered to them in
Council. Then the Speaker spoke on a Belt &amp; said
Brethren the Chief of our young People are gone out a
hunting and our Women have put up their Effects &amp;
Corn for the maintainance of their Children in the Houses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
about the French Fort and we know that all Warriors
plunder when they go on those Occasions, we desire by
this Belt that you will give orders that none of our Houses
may be plundered as we are a poor People and cannot
supply our Losses of that kind. Then I acquainted
them of the Reduction of all Canada and the terms of the
Capitulation &amp; when I met their Chiefs I would tell
them on what terms the Peace was confirmed between
all Nations of Indians and us. Then Major Rogers gave
them a string by which he took all the Indians present by
the hand &amp; lead them to D’Troit where he would have
a Conference with them and deliver them some speeches
sent by him to them from General Amherst.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> At 10

<p>25ᵗʰ.—The Indians desired Major Rogers would order
the Boats into a Cove as it was likely to be bad Weather &amp;
lay by that day &amp; they would send some men to where
their Chiefs were collected to hear News which was
agreed to.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>26ᵗʰ.—The Wind blew so hard that we could not put
out of the Cove, the Messengers the Indians sent returned
and informed us that the French were very angry with
the Indian Nations for meeting us and threatned to
burn their Towns; that the Commanding Officer would
not let us come to D’Troit till he received his Orders
from the Governor of Canada and the Capitulation to
which we answered the Indians that they might depend
on it, that if any damage was done them by the French
that we would see the damage repaired.</p>

to mend our Guns and Hatchets and a Doctor to attend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
our People when sick, we expect you will do the same

Majestys Subjects in the several British Colonies in
America.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: On Condition of your performance of
what has been said to you I by this Belt renew and
brighten the Ancient Chain of Friendship between his
Majestys Subjects, the Six United Nations and our
Brethren of the several Western Nations to the Sun setting
and wish it may continue as long as the Sun and
Moon give light.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: As my orders are to return to Pittsburg
I now recommend Capt. Campbel to you as he is appointed
by his Majestys Commander in Chief to be Governour
of this place, with him you must transact the publick
business and you may depend he will do you all the service
in his power and see that justice is done you in
Trade.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren Chiefs and Warriors</span>: As the Ancient
Friendship that long subsisted between our Ancestors
is now renewed I was[h] the Blood of[f] the Earth, that
has been shed since the present War, that you may smell
the sweet scent of the Springing Herbs &amp; bury the War
Hatchet in the Bottomless Pitt.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: I know your Warriors have all a martial
spirit &amp; must be employed at War &amp; if they want diversion
after the fatigue of hunting there is your natural
Enemies the Cherookees with whom you have been long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
at War, there your Warriors will find diversion &amp; there
they may go, they have no other place to go, as all Nations
else are become the subjects of Great Britain.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: As I command this Garrison for his
Majesty King George I must acquaint you that all the
Settlers living in this Country are my Master’s subjects
therefore I take this opportunity to desire you our Brethren
of the several Nations not to take any of their Effects from
them by force, nor kill or steal any of their Cattle, as I
shall look on any insult of that kind as if done to me, as
they are under my protection. I desire you will encourage
your young Men to hunt and bring their Meat to me for
which they shall be paid in Powder and Lead.—A belt.</p>

<p>Major Rogers acquainted the Indians that he was going
to Misselemaknach to relieve that Garrison and desired
some of their young Men to go with him, whom he would
pay for their Services and that he was sending an Officer
to Sᵗ. Josephs and the Waweoughtannes<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to relieve their
Post &amp; bring of[f] the French Garrisons &amp; desired they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
would send some of their young Men with him who
should likewise be paid for their services.—A belt.</p>

<p>Then we acquainted them by a string that as they had
requested a Smith to mend their Guns as usual &amp; the
Doctor to attend their sick that it was granted till the
Generals pleasure was known.—A string.</p>

<p>December the 4ᵗʰ.—A Principal Man of the Wayondotts
spoke and said Brethren we have heard and considered
what you said to us yesterday and are met this
day to return you an answer agreeable to our promise.</p>

<p>The Wayondott Speaker addressed his speech to
Major Rogers, Capt Campbel and myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: We have heard what you said to us
yesterday, we are like a lost People, as we have lost many
of our principal Men, &amp; we hope you will excuse us if
we should make any Mistakes, but we assure you our
Hearts are good towards our Brethren the English when
your General and Sir William Johnson took all Canada
they ordered you to send us Word, we received your
Messages &amp; we see, by your removing the French in the
manner you have from here, that what you said to us by
your Messengers is true. Brethren be it so, and continue
as you have begun for the good of us all. All the Indians
in this Country are Allies to each other and as one People,
what you have said to us is very agreeable &amp; we hope
you will continue to strengthen the Ancient Chain of
Friendship.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>You desired us yesterday to perform our promise &amp;
deliver up your Prisoners, it is very true we did promise
to deliver them up, and have since delivered up many,
what would you have us do there is very few here at
present they are all yours &amp; you shall have them as soon
as possible tho’ we do not choose to force them that have
a mind to live with us.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: Yesterday you renewed and brightened
the Ancient Chain of Friendship between our Ancestors
the Six Nations &amp; you. Brethren I am glad to hear that
you our Brethren the English and the Six Nations have
renewed and strengthened the Ancient Chain of Friendship
subsisting between us, &amp; we assure you that if ever
it be broke it will be on your side, and it is in your power
as you are an able People to preserve it, for while this
Friendship is preserved we shall be a strong Body of
People, and do not let a small matter make a difference
between us.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: Yesterday you desired us to be strong
and preserve the Chain of Friendship free from rust,
Brethren look on this Friendship Belt where we have the
Six Nations and you by the hand; this Belt was delivered
us by our Brethren the English &amp; Six Nations when first
you came over the great Water, that we might go &amp;
pass to Trade where we pleased &amp; you likewise with us,
this Belt we preserve that our Children unborn may
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: We heard what you said yesterday it
was all good but we expected two things more, first that
you would have put it out of the power of the Evil Spirit
to hurt the Chain of Friendship, and secondly that you
would have settled the prices of goods that we might
have them cheaper from you than we had from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
French as you have often told us. Brethren you have
renewed the Old Friendship yesterday, the Ancient
Chain is now become bright, it is new to our young Men,
and Brethren we now take a faster hold of it than ever
we had &amp; hope it may be preserved free from rust to our
posterity.—A belt [of] 9 rows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: This Belt is from our Warriors in behalf
of our Women &amp; Children and they desire of us to request
of you to be strong &amp; see that they have goods cheap
from your Traders &amp; not be oppressed as they have been
by the French.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>—A belt [of] 7 rows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>:—Shewing two Medals those we had from
you as a token that we might remember our Friendship
whenever we should meet in the Woods and smoke under
the Tree of Peace, we preserved your token and hope
you remember your promise, it was then said that this
Country was given by God to the Indians &amp; that you
would preserve it for our joint use where we first met
under a shade as there were no Houses in those times.</p>

<p>The same speaker addressing himself to the six Nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: I am very glad to hear what our Brethren
the English have said to us, and I now send this string by
you, and take the Chiefs of the six Nations by the hand
to come here to Council next spring.</p>

<p>Brother addressing himself to me</p>

<p>You have been employed by the King and Sir William
Johnson amongst many Nations of Indians in settling
this Peace, now you are sent here where our Council fire is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the Smoke of which ascends to the Skies you are going
away and all Nations to the Sun sitting are to meet here
to see their Brethren the English in possession of this
place and we desire that you may stay here till that Council,
that you may take your Master Word of what is to
be transacted here.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: By this String we request you will consider
it will be difficult for us to understand each other.
It would be agreeable to us if you would continue our old
Interpreter as he understands our Language well.—A
string.</p>

<p>December the 5ᵗʰ the Principal Man of the Putawatimes
spoke</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: Yesterday our Uncles of the Six Nations
spoke to you for us all; do not be surprised at it, they have
more understanding in Council affairs than us, we have
employed them to speak for us all, and Confirm what
they have said by this Belt.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: Be strong and bring large quantitys of
goods to supply us &amp; we will bring all our Furs to this
place. We are glad you acquainted us that the Inhabitants
of French here are become English subjects, we shall
look on them as such for the future and treat them as our
Brethren.—A belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: Our Uncles gave us this String of Wampum
and desired us to be strong and hunt for you, we
should be glad [if] you would fix the price to be given
for a Deer of Meat, then insisted strongly that the six
Nation Deputys should press their Chiefs to attend the
General meeting to be held here in the spring by a Belt.</p>

<p>The principal Man of the Ottawas got up and made
two speeches to the same purport as above.</p>

<p>Then I made them the following speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: I return you thanks for the several affectionate
speeches you made us yesterday. To day it is
agreed that he [the interpreter] be continued till General
Amherst and Sir William Johnson’s pleasure be known;
you likewise desired I might stay here till your General
Meeting in the Spring, I am not my own Master so
you must excuse me till I receive further Orders.—A belt.</p>

<p>Then the Present of Goods was delivered to each
Nation in his Majestys Name, for which they returned
their hearty thanks.</p>

<p>Then Major Rogers spoke to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>: I return you thanks for your readiness in
joining his Majestys Troops under my Command, on my
way here, as I soon set out to execute my orders and
relieve the Garrison of Misselemakinach I take this
opportunity of taking my leave of you, and you may be
assured I will acquaint General Amherst and Sir William
Johnson of the kind reception I have met with amongst
your Nations and recommend your services.—A belt.</p>

<p>Then the Council fire was covered up &amp; the Conference
ended.</p>

<p>7ᵗʰ.—Mr Butler of the Rangers set of[f] with an officer &amp;
party to relieve the Garrison at the Milineys<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> [Miamis]<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>

in those parts.</p>

<p>The 8ᵗʰ.—Major Rogers set of[f] for Misselemachinack

Nations that Inhabit it.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The 9ᵗʰ &amp; 10ᵗʰ.—Capt Campble assembled all the Inhabitants
and read the Act of Parliament to them &amp;

Provisions for the Garrison, and indeed every thing in
their power for his Majestys service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Croghan’s Journal</span>, 1765<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></h4>

<p>May 15th, 1765.—I set off from fort Pitt with two
batteaux, and encamped at Chartier’s Island, in the Ohio,
three miles below Fort Pitt.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>16th.—Being joined by the deputies of the Senecas,
Shawnesse, and Delawares, that were to accompany me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
we set off at seven o’clock in the morning, and at ten
o’clock arrived at the Logs Town, an old settlement of
the Shawnesse, about seventeen miles from Fort Pitt,
where we put ashore, and viewed the remains of that
village, which was situated on a high bank, on the south
side of the Ohio river, a fine fertile country round it. At
11 o’clock we re-embarked and proceeded down the Ohio
to the mouth of Big Beaver Creek, about ten miles below
the Logs Town: this creek empties itself between two
fine rich bottoms, a mile wide on each side from the banks
of the river to the highlands. About a mile below the
mouth of Beaver Creek we passed an old settlement of the
Delawares, where the French, in 1756, built a town for
that nation. On the north side of the river some of the
stone chimneys are yet remaining; here the highlands
come close to the banks and continue so for about five
miles. After which we passed several spacious bottoms
on each side of the river, and came to Little Beaver
Creek, about fifteen miles below Big Beaver Creek. A
number of small rivulets fall into the river on each side.
From thence we sailed to Yellow Creek,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> being about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
fifteen miles from the last mentioned creek; here and
there the hills come close to the banks of the river on each
side, but where there are bottoms, they are very large,
and well watered; numbers of small rivulets running
through them, falling into the Ohio on both sides. We
encamped on the river bank, and found a great part of the
trees in the bottom are covered with grape vines. This
day we passed by eleven islands, one of which being about
seven miles long. For the most part of the way we made
this day, the banks of the river are high and steep. The
course of the Ohio from Fort Pitt to the mouth of Beaver
Creek inclines to the north-west; from thence to the two
creeks partly due west.</p>

<p>17th.—At 6 o’clock in the morning we embarked: and
were delighted with the prospect of a fine open country
on each side of the river as we passed down. We came
to a place called the Two Creeks, about fifteen miles from
Yellow Creek, where we put to shore; here the Senecas
have a village on a high bank, on the north side of the
river; the chief of this village offered me his service to go
with me to the Illinois, which I could not refuse for fear
of giving him offence, although I had a sufficient number
of deputies with me already.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> From thence we proceeded
down the river, passed many large, rich, and fine
bottoms; the highlands being at a considerable distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
from the river banks, till we came to the Buffalo Creek,
being about ten miles below the Seneca village; and from
Buffalo Creek, we proceeded down the river to Fat Meat
Creek, about thirty miles.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The face of the country
appears much like what we met with before; large, rich, and
well watered bottoms, then succeeded by the hills pinching
close on the river; these bottoms, on the north side,
appear rather low, and consequently subject to inundations,
in the spring of the year, when there never fail to be
high freshes in the Ohio, owing to the melting of the snows.
This day we passed by ten fine islands, though the greatest
part of them are small. They lay much higher out of
the water than the main land, and of course less subject
to be flooded by the freshes. At night we encamped near
an Indian village. The general course of the river from the
Two Creeks to Fat Meat Creek inclines to the southwest.</p>

<p>18th.—At 6 o’clock, A.M. we set off in our batteaux;
the country on both sides of the river appears delightful;
the hills are several miles from the river banks, and consequently
the bottoms large; the soil, timber, and banks
of the river, much like those we have before described;
about fifty miles below Fat Meat Creek, we enter the
long reach, where the river runs a straight course for
twenty miles, and makes a delightful prospect; the banks
continue high; the country on both sides, level, rich, and
well watered. At the lower end of the reach we encamped.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
This day we passed nine islands, some of
which are large, and lie high out of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>19th.—We decamped at six in the morning, and sailed
to a place called the Three Islands, being about fifteen
miles from our last encampment; here the highlands come
close to the river banks, and the bottoms for the most
part—till we come to the Muskingum (or Elk)<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> river—are
but narrow: this river empties itself into the Ohio
about fifteen miles below the Three Islands; the banks of
the river continue steep, and the country is level, for
several miles back from the river. The course of the
river from Fat Meat Creek to Elk River, is about southwest
and by south. We proceeded down the river about
fifteen miles, to the mouth of Little Conhawa River, with
little or no alteration in the face of the country; here we
encamped in a fine rich bottom, after having passed
fourteen islands, some of them large, and mostly lying
high out of the water.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Here buffaloes, bears, turkeys,
with all other kinds of wild game are extremely plenty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
A good hunter, without much fatigue to himself, could
here supply daily one hundred men with meat. The
course of the Ohio, from Elk River to Little Conhawa, is
about south.</p>

<p>20th.—At six in the morning we embarked in our
boats, and proceeded down to the mouth of Hochocken
or Bottle River,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> where we were obliged to encamp,
having a strong head wind against us. We made but
twenty miles this day, and passed by five very fine islands,
the country the whole way being rich and level, with high
and steep banks to the rivers. From here I despatched
an Indian to the Plains of Scioto, with a letter to the
French traders from the Illinois residing there, amongst
the Shawnesse, requiring them to come and join me at the
mouth of Scioto, in order to proceed with me to their
own country, and take the oaths of allegiance to his
Britannic Majesty, as they were now become his subjects,
and had no right to trade there without license.
At the same time I sent messages to the Shawnesse Indians
to oblige the French to come to me in case of refusal.</p>

<p>21st.—We embarked at half past 8 o’clock in the morning,
and sailed to a place called the Big Bend, about
thirty-five miles below Bottle River. The course of the
Ohio, from Little Conhawa River to Big Bend, is about
south-west by south. The country hereabouts abounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
with buffalo, bears, deer, and all sorts of wild game, in such
plenty, that we killed out of our boats as much as we
wanted. We proceeded down the river to the Buffalo
Bottom, about ten miles from the beginning of the Big
Bend, where we encamped. The country on both sides
of the river, much the same as we passed the day before.
This day we passed nine islands, all lying high out of the
water.</p>

<p>22d.—At half an hour past 5 o’clock, set off and sailed
to a place, called Alum Hill, so called from the great
quantity of that mineral found there by the Indians; this
place lies about ten miles from Buffalo Bottom;<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> thence
we sailed to the mouth of Great Conhawa River,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
being ten miles from the Alum Hill. The course of the
river, from the Great Bend to this place, is mostly west;
from hence we proceeded down to Little Guyondott
River, where we encamped, about thirty miles from Great
Conhawa; the country still fine and level; the bank of the
river high, with abundance of creeks and rivulets falling
into it. This day we passed six fine islands. In the
evening one of our Indians discovered three Cherokees
near our encampment, which obliged our Indians to keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
out a good guard the first part of the night. Our party
being pretty strong, I imagine the Cherokees were afraid to
attack us, and so ran off.</p>

<p>23d.—Decamped about five in the morning, and
arrived at Big Guyondott, twenty miles from our last
encampment: the country as of yesterday; from hence we
proceeded down to Sandy River being twenty miles
further; thence to the mouth of Scioto, about forty miles
from the last mentioned river. The general course of
the river from Great Conhawa to this place inclines to
the south-west. The soil rich, the country level, and
the banks of the river high. The soil on the banks of
Scioto, for a vast distance up the country, is prodigious
rich, the bottoms very wide, and in the spring of the year,
many of them are flooded, so that the river appears to
be two or three miles wide. Bears, deer, turkeys, and
most sorts of wild game, are very plenty on the banks of
this river. On the Ohio, just below the mouth of Scioto,
on a high bank, near forty feet, formerly stood the Shawnesse
town, called the Lower Town, which was all carried
away, except three or four houses, by a great flood
in the Scioto. I was in the town at the time, though the
banks of the Ohio were so high, the water was nine feet
on the top, which obliged the whole town to take to their
canoes, and move with their effects to the hills. The
Shawnesse afterwards built their town on the opposite
side of the river, which, during the French war, they
abandoned, for fear of the Virginians, and removed to the
plains on Scioto. The Ohio is about one hundred yards
wider here than at Fort Pitt, which is but a small augumentation,
considering the great number of rivers and creeks,
that fall into it during the course of four hundred and
twenty miles; and as it deepens but very little, I imagine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
the water sinks, though there is no visible appearance of
it. In general all the lands on the Scioto River, as well as
the bottoms on Ohio, are too rich for any thing but hemp,
flax, or Indian corn.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>24th, 25th, and 26th.—Stayed at the mouth of Scioto,
waiting for the Shawnesse and French traders, who
arrived here on the evening of the 26th, in consequence
of the message I sent them from Hochocken, or Bottle
Creek.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>27th.—The Indians requested me to stay this day,
which I could not refuse.</p>

<p>28th.—We set off: passing down the Ohio, the country
on both sides the river level; the banks continue high.
This day we came sixty miles; passed no islands. The
river being wider and deeper, we drove all night.</p>

<p>29th.—We came to the little Miame River, having proceeded
sixty miles last night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>30th.—We passed the Great Miame River, about
thirty miles from the little river of that name, <i>and in the
evening arrived at the place where the Elephants’ bones are
found</i>, where we encamped, intending to take a view of
the place next morning. This day we came about
seventy miles. The country on both sides level, and rich
bottoms well watered.</p>

<p>31st.—<i>Early in the morning we went to the great Lick,
where those bones are only found, about four miles from the
river, on the south-east side. In our way we passed
through a fine timbered clear wood; we came into a large road
which the Buffaloes have beaten, spacious enough for two
waggons to go abreast, and leading straight into the Lick.</i>
It appears that there are vast quantities of these bones lying
five or six feet under ground, which we discovered in the
bank, at the edge of the Lick. We found here two tusks
above six feet long; we carried one, with some other bones,
to our boats, and set off.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> This day we proceeded down
the river about eighty miles, through a country much the
same as already described, since we passed the Scioto.
In this day’s journey we passed the mouth of the River
Kentucky, or Holsten’s River.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p><i>June 1st.</i>—We arrived within a mile of the Falls of
Ohio, where we encamped, after coming about fifty
miles this day.</p>

<p>2d.—Early in the morning we embarked, and passed
the Falls. The river being very low we were obliged to
lighten our boats, and pass on the north side of a little
island, which lays in the middle of the river. In general,
what is called the Fall here, is no more than rapids; and
in the least fresh, a batteau of any size may come and go
on each side without any risk.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This day we proceeded
sixty miles, in the course of which we passed Pidgeon
River. The country pretty high on each side of the River
Ohio.</p>

<p>3d.—In the forepart of this day’s course, we passed
high lands; about mid-day we came to a fine, flat, and
level country, called by the Indians the Low Lands; no
hills to be seen. We came about eighty miles this day,
and encamped.</p>

<p>4th.—We came to a place called the Five Islands; these
islands are very long, and succeed one another in a chain;
the country still flat and level, the soil exceedingly rich,
and well watered. The highlands are at least fifty miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
from the banks of the Ohio. In this day’s course we
passed about ninety miles, the current being very strong.</p>

<p>5th.—Having passed the Five Islands, we came to a
place called the Owl River. Came about forty miles this
day. The country the same as yesterday.</p>

<p>6th.—We arrived at the mouth of the Ouabache,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
where we found a breast-work erected, supposed to be
done by the Indians. The mouth of this river is about
two hundred yards wide, and in its course runs through
one of the finest countries in the world, the lands being
exceedingly rich, and well watered; here hemp might be
raised in immense quantities. All the bottoms, and
almost the whole country abounds with great plenty of
the white and red mulberry tree. These trees are to be
found in great plenty, in all places between the mouth of
Scioto and the Ouabache: the soil of the latter affords
this tree in plenty as far as Ouicatonon, and some few
on the Miame River. Several large fine islands lie in the
Ohio, opposite the mouth of the Ouabache, the banks of
which are high, and consequently free from inundations;
hence we proceeded down the river about six miles to
encamp, as I judged some Indians were sent to way-lay
us, and came to a place called the Old Shawnesse Village,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
some of that nation having formerly lived there.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In
this day’s proceedings we came about seventy-six miles.
The general course of the river; from Scioto to this place,
is south-west.</p>

<p>7th.—We stayed here and despatched two Indians to
the Illinois by land, with letters to Lord Frazer, an English
officer, who had been sent there from Fort Pitt, and
Monsieur St. Ange,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> the French commanding officer at
Fort Chartres, and some speeches to the Indians there,
letting them know of my arrival here; that peace was made
between us and the Six Nations, Delawares, and Shawnesse,
and of my having a number of deputies of those
nations along with me, to conclude matters with them
also on my arrival there. This day one of my men went
into the woods and lost himself.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>8th.—At day-break we were attacked by a party of
Indians, consisting of eighty warriors of the Kiccapoos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and Musquattimes,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> who killed two of my men and three
Indians, wounded myself and all the rest of my party,
except two white men and one Indian; then made myself
and all the white men prisoners, plundering us of every
thing we had. A deputy of the Shawnesse who was shot
through the thigh, having concealed himself in the woods
for a few minutes after he was wounded—not knowing
but they were Southern Indians, who are always at war
with the northward Indians—after discovering what
nation they were, came up to them and made a very bold
speech, telling them that the whole northward Indians
would join in taking revenge for the insult and murder
of their people; this alarmed those savages very much,
who began excusing themselves, saying their fathers, the
French, had spirited them up, telling them that the Indians
were coming with a body of southern Indians to take
their country from them, and enslave them; that it was
this that induced them to commit this outrage. After
dividing the plunder, (they left great part of the heaviest
effects behind, not being able to carry them,) they set off
with us to their village at Ouattonon, in a great hurry,
being in dread of pursuit from a large party of Indians
they suspected were coming after me. Our course was
through a thick woody country, crossing a great many
swamps, morasses, and beaver ponds. We traveled this
day about forty-two miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>9th.—An hour before day we set out on our march;
passed through thick woods, some highlands, and small
savannahs, badly watered. Traveled this day about
thirty miles.</p>

<p>10th.—We set out very early in the morning, and
marched through a high country, extremely well timbered,
for three hours; then came to a branch of the Ouabache,
which we crossed.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The remainder of this day we
traveled through fine rich bottoms, overgrown with reeds,
which make the best pasture in the world, the young
reeds being preferable to sheaf oats. Here is great
plenty of wild game of all kinds. Came this day about
twenty-eight, or thirty miles.</p>

<p>11th.—At day-break we set off, making our way
through a thin woodland, interspersed with savannahs. I
suffered extremely by reason of the excessive heat of the
weather, and scarcity of water; the little springs and runs
being dried up. Traveled this day about thirty miles.</p>

<p>12th.—We passed through some large savannahs, and
clear woods; in the afternoon we came to the Ouabache;
then marched along it through a prodigious rich bottom,
overgrown with reeds and wild hemp; all this bottom is
well watered, and an exceeding fine hunting ground.
Came this day about thirty miles.</p>

<p>13th.—About an hour before day we set out; traveled
through such bottoms as of yesterday, and through some
large meadows, where no trees, for several miles together,
are to be seen. Buffaloes, deer, and bears are here in
great plenty. We traveled about twenty-six miles this
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>14th.—The country we traveled through this day,
appears the same as described yesterday, excepting this
afternoon’s journey through woodland, to cut off a bend
of the river. Came about twenty-seven miles this day.</p>

<p>15th.—We set out very early, and about one o’clock
came to the Ouabache, within six or seven miles of Port
Vincent.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> On my arrival there, I found a village of
about eighty or ninety French families settled on the east
side of this river, being one of the finest situations that can
be found. The country is level and clear, and the soil
very rich, producing wheat and tobacco. I think the
latter preferable to that of Maryland or Virginia. The
French inhabitants hereabouts, are an idle, lazy people, a
parcel of renegadoes from Canada, and are much worse
than the Indians. They took a secret pleasure at our
misfortunes, and the moment we arrived, they came to
the Indians, exchanging trifles for their valuable plunder.
As the savages took from me a considerable quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
gold and silver in specie, the French traders extorted ten
half johannes<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> from them for one pound of vermilion.
Here is likewise an Indian village of the Pyankeshaws,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
who were much displeased with the party that took me,
telling them that “our and your chiefs are gone to make
peace, and you have begun a war, for which our women
and children will have reason to cry.” From this post
the Indians permitted me to write to the commander, at
Fort Chartres, but would not suffer me to write to any
body else, (this I apprehend was a precaution of the
French, lest their villany should be perceived too soon,)
although the Indians had given me permission to write
to Sir William Johnson and Fort Pitt on our march,
before we arrived at this place. But immediately after
our arrival they had a private council with the French, in
which the Indians urged, (as they afterwards informed me,)
that as the French had engaged them in so bad an affair,
which was likely to bring a war on their nation, they now
expected a proof of their promise and assistance. Then
delivered the French a scalp and part of the plunder, and
wanted to deliver some presents to the Pyankeshaws, but
they refused to accept of any, and declared they would not
be concerned in the affair. This last information I got
from the Pyankeshaws, as I had been well acquainted
with them several years before this time.</p>

<p>Port Vincent is a place of great consequence for trade,
being a fine hunting country all along the Ouabache, and
too far for the Indians, which reside hereabouts, to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
either to the Illinois, or elsewhere, to fetch their necessaries.</p>

<p>16th.—We were obliged to stay here to get some little
apparel made up for us, and to buy some horses for our
journey to Ouicatonon, promising payment at Detroit,
for we could not procure horses from the French for hire;
though we were greatly fatigued, and our spirits much
exhausted in our late march, they would lend us no assistance.</p>

<p>17th.—At mid-day we set out; traveling the first five
miles through a fine thick wood. We traveled eighteen
miles this day, and encamped in a large, beautiful, well
watered meadow.</p>

<p>18th and 19th.—We traveled through a prodigious
large meadow, called the Pyankeshaw’s Hunting Ground:
here is no wood to be seen, and the country appears like
an ocean: the ground is exceedingly rich, and partly
overgrown with wild hemp; the land well watered, and
full of buffalo, deer, bears, and all kinds of wild game.</p>

<p>20th and 21st.—We passed through some very large
meadows, part of which belong to the Pyankeshaws on
Vermilion River; the country and soil much the same as
that we traveled over for these three days past, wild hemp
grows here in abundance; the game very plenty: at any
time, in half an hour we could kill as much as we wanted.</p>

<p>22nd.—We passed through part of the same meadow
as mentioned yesterday; then came to a high woodland,
and arrived at Vermilion River, so called from a fine red
earth found here by the Indians, with which they paint
themselves. About half a mile from the place where we
crossed this river, there is a village of Pyankeshaws, distinguished
by the addition of the name of the river. We
then traveled about three hours, through a clear high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
woody country, but a deep and rich soil; then came to a
meadow, where we encamped.</p>

<p>23d.—Early in the morning we set out through a fine
meadow, then some clear woods; in the afternoon came
into a very large bottom on the Ouabache, within six
miles of Ouicatanon; here I met several chiefs of the
Kickapoos and Musquattimes, who spoke to their young
men who had taken us, and reprimanded them severely
for what they had done to me, after which they returned
with us to their village, and delivered us all to their chiefs.</p>

<p>The distance from port Vincent to Ouicatanon is two
hundred and ten miles. This place is situated on the
Ouabache. About fourteen French families are living
in the fort, which stands on the north side of the river.
The Kickapoos and the Musquattimes, whose warriors
had taken us, live nigh the fort, on the same side of the
river, where they have two villages; and the Ouicatanons
have a village on the south side of the river. At our
arrival at this post, several of the Wawcottonans, (or
Ouicatonans) with whom I had been formerly acquainted,
came to visit me, and seemed greatly concerned at what
had happened. They went immediately to the Kickapoos
and Musquattimes, and charged them to take the
greatest care of us, till their chiefs should arrive from the
Illinois, where they were gone to meet me some time ago,
and who were entirely ignorant of this affair, and said the
French had spirited up this party to go and strike us.</p>

<p>The French have a great influence over these Indians,
and never fail in telling them many lies to the prejudice
of his majesty’s interest, by making the English nation
odious and hateful to them. I had the greatest difficulties
in removing these prejudices. As these Indians are a
weak, foolish, and credulous people, they are easily imposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
on by a designing people, who have led them
hitherto as they pleased. The French told them that
as the southern Indians had for two years past made war
on them, it must have been at the instigation of the English,
who are a bad people. However I have been fortunate
enough to remove their prejudice, and, in a great
measure, their suspicions against the English. The country
hereabouts is exceedingly pleasant, being open and
clear for many miles; the soil very rich and well watered;
all plants have a quick vegetation, and the climate very
temperate through the winter. This post has always been
a very considerable trading place. The great plenty of
furs taken in this country, induced the French to establish
this post, which was the first on the Ouabache, and by
a very advantageous trade they have been richly recompensed
for their labor.</p>

<p>On the south side of the Ouabache runs a big bank, in
which are several fine coal mines, and behind this bank,
is a very large meadow, clear for several miles. It is
surprising what false information we have had respecting
this country: some mention these spacious and beautiful
meadows as large and barren savannahs. I apprehend
it has been the artifice of the French to keep us ignorant
of the country. These meadows bear fine wild grass,
and wild hemp ten or twelve feet high, which, if properly
manufactured, would prove as good, and answer all the
purposes of the hemp we cultivate.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>July 1ˢᵗ—A Frenchman arrived from the Illinois with
a Pipe and Speech from thence to the Kickapoos &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Musquattamies, to have me Burnt, this Speech was said
to be sent from a Shawanese Indⁿ who resides at the
Ilinois, &amp; has been during the War, &amp; is much attached
to the French interest. As soon as this Speech was delivered
to the Indians by the French, the Indians informed
me of it in Council, &amp; expressed their great concern for
what had already happened, &amp; told me they then sett me
&amp; my people at liberty, &amp; assured me they despised the
message sent them, and would return the Pipe &amp; Belt to
their Fathers the French, and enquire into the reason of
such a message being sent them by one of his messengers,
&amp; desired me to stay with them ’till the Deputies of the
Six Nations, Shawanese &amp; Delawares arrived with Pondiac
at Ouiatonon in order to settle matters, to wʰ I
consented.</p>

<p>From 4ᵗʰ to the 8ᵗʰ—I had several Conferences with
the Wawiotonans, Pyankeeshas, Kickapoos &amp; Musquatamies
in which Conferences I was lucky enough to
reconcile those Nations to his Majesties Interest &amp; obtain
their Consent and Approbation to take Possession of any
Posts in their country which the French formerly possessed
&amp; an offer of their service should any Nation oppose our
taking possession of it, all which they confirmed by four
large Pipes.</p>

<p>11ᵗʰ—Mʳ Maisonville<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> arrived with an Interpreter &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
a message to the Indians to bring me &amp; my party to the
Ilinois, till then I had no answer from Mʳ St. Ange to
the letter I wrote him of the 16ᵗʰ June, as I wanted to go
to the Ilinois, I desired the Chiefs to prepare themselves &amp;
set off with me as soon as possible.</p>

<p>12ᵗʰ—I wrote to General Gage<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> &amp; Sir William Johnson,
to Colᵒ Campbell at Detroit, &amp; Major Murray at
Fort Pitt &amp; Major Firmer at Mobiel or on his way to
the Mississipi,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> &amp; acquainted [them with] every thing
that had happened since my departure from Ft. Pitt.</p>

<p>July 13ᵗʰ—The Chiefs of the Twightwees came to me
from the Miamis and renewed their Antient Friendship
with His Majesty &amp; all his Subjects in America &amp; confirmed
it with a Pipe.</p>

<p>18ᵗʰ—I set off for the Ilinois with the Chiefs of all
those Nations when by the way we met with Pondiac
together with the Deputies of the Six Nations, Delawares
&amp; Shawanese, which accompanied Mʳ Frazier &amp; myself
down the Ohio &amp; also Deputies with speeches from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
four Nations living in the Ilinois Country to me &amp; the
Six Nations, Delawares &amp; Shawanese, on which we
return’d to Ouiatonon and there held another conference,
in which I settled all matters with the Ilinois Indians—Pondiac
&amp; they agreeing to every thing the other Nations
had done, all which they confirmed by Pipes &amp; Belts,
but told me the French had informed them that the English
intended to take their Country from them, &amp; give
it to the Cherokees to settle on, &amp; that if ever they suffered
the English to take possession of their Country
they would make slaves of them, that this was the reason
of their Opposing the English hitherto from taking possession
of <i>Fort Chartres</i> &amp; induced them to tell Mr. La
Gutrie &amp; Mʳ Sinnott<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> that they would not let the English
come into their Country. But being informed since
Mʳ Sinnott had retired by the Deputies of the Six Nations,
Delawares &amp; Shawanese, that every difference
subsisting between them &amp; the English was now settled,
they were willing to comply as the other Nations
their Brethren had done and desired that their Father the
King of England might not look upon his taking possession
of the Forts which the French had formerly possest
as a title for his subjects to possess their Country, as they
never had sold any part of it to the French, &amp; that I
might rest satisfied that whenever the English came to
take possession they would receive them with open arms.</p>

<p><i>July 25th.</i><a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>—We set out from this place (after settling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
all matters happily with the natives) for the Miames,
and traveled the whole way through a fine rich bottom,
overgrown with wild hemp, alongside the Ouabache, till
we came to Eel River, where we arrived the 27th. About
six miles up this river is a small village of the Twightwee,
situated on a very delightful spot of ground on the bank
of the river. The Eel River heads near St. Joseph’s, and
runs nearly parallel to the Miames, and at some few miles
distance from it, through a fine, pleasant country, and
after a course of about one hundred and eighty miles
empties itself into the Ouabache.</p>

<p>28th, 29th, 30th and 31st.—We traveled still along side
the Eel River, passing through fine clear woods, and some
good meadows, though not so large as those we passed
some days before. The country is more overgrown with
woods, the soil is sufficiently rich, and well watered with
springs.</p>

<p><i>August 1st.</i>—We arrived at the carrying place between
the River Miames and the Ouabache, which is about nine
miles long in dry seasons, but not above half that length
in freshes. The head of the Ouabache is about forty
miles from this place, and after a course of about seven
hundred and sixty miles from the head spring, through
one of the finest countries in the world, it empties itself
into the Ohio. The navigation from hence to Ouicatanon,
is very difficult in low water, on account of many rapids
and rifts; but in freshes, which generally happen in the
spring and fall, batteaux or canoes will pass, without
difficulty, from here to Ouicatanon in three days, which
is about two hundred and forty miles, and by land about
two hundred and ten miles. From Ouicatanon to Port
Vincent, and thence to the Ohio, batteaux and canoes may
go at any season of the year. Throughout the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
course of the Ouabache the banks are pretty high, and in
the river are a great many islands. Many shrubs and
trees are found here unknown to us.</p>

<p>Within a mile of the Twightwee village, I was met by
the chiefs of that nation, who received us very kindly.
The most part of these Indians knew me, and conducted
me to their village, where they immediately hoisted an
English flag that I had formerly given them at Fort Pitt.
The next day they held a council, after which they gave
me up all the English prisoners they had, then made
several speeches, in all which they expressed the great
pleasure it gave them, to see the unhappy differences
which embroiled the several nations in a war with their
brethren, the English, were now so near a happy conclusion,
and that peace was established in their country.</p>

<p>The Twightwee village is situated on both sides of a
river, called St. Joseph’s. This river, where it falls into
the Miame river, about a quarter of a mile from this
place, is one hundred yards wide, on the east side of which
stands a stockade fort, somewhat ruinous.</p>

<p>The Indian village consists of about forty or fifty
cabins, besides nine or ten French houses, a runaway
colony from Detroit, during the late Indian war; they
were concerned in it, and being afraid of punishment,
came to this post, where ever since they have spirited
up the Indians against the English. All the French
residing here are a lazy, indolent people, fond of breeding
mischief, and spiriting up the Indians against the English,
and should by no means be suffered to remain here.
The country is pleasant, the soil rich and well watered.
After several conferences with these Indians, and their
delivering me up all the English prisoners they had,—[blank
space in MS.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>On the 6th of August we set out for Detroit, down the
Miames river in a canoe. This river heads about ten
miles from hence. The river is not navigable till you
come where the river St. Joseph joins it, and makes a
considerably large stream. Nevertheless we found a
great deal of difficulty in getting our canoe over shoals,
as the waters at this season were very low. The banks
of the river are high, and the country overgrown with
lofty timber of various kinds; the land is level, and the
woods clear. About ninety miles from the Miames or
Twightwee, we came to where a large river, that heads
in a large lick, falls into the Miame river; this they call
the Forks.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The Ottawas claim this country, and hunt
here, where game is very plenty. From hence we proceeded
to the Ottawa village. This nation formerly lived
at Detroit, but is now settled here, on account of the
richness of the country, where game is always to be found
in plenty. Here we were obliged to get out of our canoes,
and drag them eighteen miles, on account of the rifts
which interrupt the navigation.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> At the end of these
rifts, we came to a village of the Wyondotts, who received
us very kindly and from thence we proceeded to the
mouth of the river, where it falls into Lake Erie. From
the Miames to the lake is computed one hundred and
eighty miles, and from the entrance of the river into the
lake to Detroit, is sixty miles; that is, forty-two miles up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the lake, and eighteen miles up the Detroit river to the
garrison of that name. The land on the lake side is low
and flat. We passed several large rivers and bays, and
on the 16th of August, in the afternoon, we arrived at
Detroit river. The country here is much higher than
on the lake side; the river is about nine hundred yards
wide, and the current runs very strong. There are several
fine and large islands in this river, one of which is nine
miles long; its banks high, and the soil very good.</p>

<p>17th.—In the morning we arrived at the fort, which
is a large stockade, inclosing about eighty houses, it
stands close on the north side of the river, on a high bank,
commands a very pleasant prospect for nine miles above,
and nine miles below the fort; the country is thick settled
with French, their plantations are generally laid out about
three or four acres in breadth on the river, and eighty
acres in depth; the soil is good, producing plenty of
grain. All the people here are generally poor wretches,
and consist of three or four hundred French families, a
lazy, idle people, depending chiefly on the savages for
their subsistence; though the land, with little labor, produces
plenty of grain, they scarcely raise as much as will
supply their wants, in imitation of the Indians, whose
manners and customs they have entirely adopted, and
cannot subsist without them. The men, women, and
children speak the Indian tongue perfectly well. In the
last Indian war the most part of the French were concerned
in it, (although the whole settlement had taken
the oath of allegiance to his Britannic Majesty) they
have, therefore, great reason to be thankful to the English
clemency in not bringing them to deserved punishment.
Before the late Indian war there resided three
nations of Indians at this place: the Putawatimes, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
village was on the west side of the river, about one mile
below the fort; the Ottawas, on the east side, about three
miles above the Fort; and the Wyondotts, whose village
lies on the east side, about two miles below the fort.
The former two nations have removed to a considerable
distance, and the latter still remain where they were, and
are remarkable for their good sense and hospitality.
They have a particular attachment to the Roman Catholic
religion, the French, by their priests, having taken uncommon
pains to instruct them.</p>

<p>During my stay here, I held frequent conferences with
the different nations of Indians assembled at this place,
with whom I settled matters to their general satisfaction.</p>

<p>August 17ᵗʰ<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>—I arrived at Detroit where I found
several small Tribes of Ottawas, Puttewatamies &amp;
Chipwas waiting in Consequence of Colᵒ Bradstreets
Invitation to see him.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Here I met <i>Mʳ DeCouagne</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
<i>Wabecomicat</i> with a Deputation of Indians from Niagara,
with Messages from Sir William Johnson to Pondiac &amp;
those Western Nations.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>23ᵈ—Colo Campbell<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> &amp; I had a Meeting with the
Twightwees, Wawiotonans, Pyankeshas, Kickapoos and
Musquattamies, when they produced the several Belts
sent them by Colᵒ Bradstreet, in consequence of which
Invitation they came here.</p>

<p>Then they spoake to the Six Nations Delawares &amp;
Shawanese on several Belts &amp; Pipes, beging in the most
abject manner that they would forgive them for the ill
conduct of their Young Men, to take Pity on their Women
&amp; Children &amp; grant yᵐ peace.</p>

<p>They then spoake to the Colᵒ &amp; me on several Pipes &amp;
Belts Expressing their great satisfaction at a firm and lasting
Peace settled between their Bretheren the English, &amp;
the several Indian Nations in this Country, that they saw
the heavy Clouds that hung over their heads for some
time past were now dispersed, and that the Sun shone
clear &amp; bright, &amp; that as their Father the King of England
had conquered the French in that [this] Country &amp;
taken into his Friendship all the Indian Nations, they
hoped for the future they would be a happy people, &amp;
that they should always have reason to call the English
their Fathers &amp; beged we would take pity on their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Women &amp; Children, &amp; make up the difference subsisting
between them and the Shawanese, Delawares &amp; Six
Nations, and said as they were come here in consequence of
Colᵒ Bradstreet’s Invitation, &amp; that he had not met them
they hoped their Fathers would pity their necessity &amp;
give them a little clothing, and a little rum to drink on the
road, as they had come a great way to see their Fathers.
Then the Wyondats spoake to the Shawanese, &amp; all the
Western Nations on severall Belts &amp; strings, by which
they exhorted the several Nations to behave themselves
well to their Fathers the English, who had now taken
them under their Protection, that if they did, they would
be a happy People, that if they did not listen to the Councils
of their Fathers, they must take the Consequences,
having assured them that all Nations to the Sun rising
had taken fast hold of their Fathers the English by the
hand, &amp; would follow their Advice, &amp; do every thing they
desired them, &amp; never would let slip the Chain of Friendship
now so happily renewed.</p>

<p>August 24ᵗʰ—We had another Meeting with the
Several Nations, when the Wawiotonans, Twightwees,
Pyankeshas, Kickapoos &amp; Musquatamies made several
speeches to Colᵒ Campbell &amp; me, in presence of all the
other Nations, when they promised to become the Children
of the King of Great Britain &amp; farther acknowledged
that they had at Ouiatonon before they came there [here]
given up the Soverignty of their Country to me for His
Majesty, &amp; promised to support his subjects in taking
possession of all the Posts given up by the French their
former Fathers, to the English, now their present Fathers,
all which they confirmed with a Belt.</p>

<p>25ᵗʰ—We had another meeting with the same Indians,
when Colᵒ Campbell &amp; I made them several speeches in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
answer to theirs of the 23 &amp; 24ᵗʰ then delivered them a
Road Belt in the name of Sir William Johnson Baronet,
to open a Road from the rising to the setting of the Sun
which we charged them to keep open through their
Country &amp; cautioned them to stop their Ears against the
Storys or idle reports of evil minded People &amp; continue
to promote the good Works of Peace, all which they promised
to do in a most sincere manner.</p>

<p>26ᵗʰ—Colᵒ Campbell &amp; I made those Nations some
presents, when after taking leave of us, they sett off for
their own Country well satisfied.</p>

<p>27ᵗʰ—We had a Meeting with Pondiac &amp; all the
Ottawa Tribes, Chipwaes &amp; Puttewatamies wᵗʰ the
Hurons of this Place &amp; the chiefs of those settled at
Sandusky &amp; the Miamis River, when we made them the
following Speeches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children Pondiac &amp; all our Children the Ottawas,
Puttewatamies, Chipways &amp; Wyondatts</span>: We
are very glad to see so many of our Children here present
at your Antient Council Fire, which has been neglected
for some time past, since those high winds has arose &amp;
raised some heavy clouds over your Country, I now by
this Belt dress up your Antient Fire &amp; throw some dry
wood upon it, that the blaze may ascend to the Clouds so
that all Nations may see it, &amp; know that you live in
Peace &amp; Tranquility with your Fathers the English.—A
Belt.</p>

<p>By this Belt I disperse all the black clouds from over
your heads, that the Sun may shine clear on your Women
and Children, that those unborn may enjoy the blessings
of this General Peace, now so happily settled between
your Fathers the English &amp; you &amp; all your younger
Bretheren to the Sun setting.—A Belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Children: By this Belt I gather up all the Bones of
your deceased friends, &amp; bury them deep in the ground,
that the herbs &amp; sweet flowers of the earth may grow
over them, that we may not see them any more.—A Belt.</p>

<p>Children: with this Belt I take the Hatchet out of
your Hands &amp; I pluck up a large tree &amp; bury it deep, so
that it may never be found any more, &amp; I plant the tree
of Peace, where all our children may sit under &amp; smoak
in Peace with their Fathers.—A Belt.</p>

<p>Children: We have made a Road from the Sun rising
to the Sun setting, I desire that you will preserve that
Road good and pleasant to Travel upon, that we may all
share the blessings of this happy Union. I am sorry to
see our Children dispersed thro’ the Woods, I therefore
desire you will return to your Antient Settlements &amp; take
care of your Council Fire which I have now dressed up, &amp;
promote the good work of Peace.—A Belt.</p>

<p>After which Wapicomica delivered his Messages from
Sir William Johnson to Pondiac &amp; the rest of the several
Chiefs.</p>

<p>Aug. 28ᵗʰ—We had a Meeting with Pondiac &amp; the several
Nations when Pondiac made the following Speeches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span>: We have all smoaked out of the Pipe of
Peace its your Childrens Pipe &amp; as the War is all over, &amp;
the Great Spirit and Giver of Light who has made the
Earth &amp; every thing therein, has brought us all together
this day for our mutual good to promote the good Works
of Peace, I declare to all Nations that I had settled my
Peace with you before I came here, &amp; now deliver my
Pipe to be sent to <i>Sir William Johnson</i> that he may know
I have made Peace, &amp; taken the King of England for my
Father, in presence of all the Nations now assembled, &amp;
whenever any of those Nations go to visit him, they may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
smoak out of it with him in Peace. Fathers we are
oblidged to you for lighting up our old Council Fire for
us, &amp; desiring us to return to it, but we are now settled
on the Miamis River, not far from hence, whenever you
want us you will find us there ready to wait on you, the
reason I choose to stay where we are now settled, is,
that we love liquor, and did we live here as formerly, our
People would be always drunk, which might occasion
some quarrels between the Soldiers &amp; them, this Father
is all the reason I have for not returning to our old Settlements,
&amp; that we live so nigh this place, that when we
want to drink, we can easily come for it.—Gave a large
Pipe with a Belt of Wampum tied to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span>: Be strong and take pity on us your Children
as our former Father did, ’tis just the Hunting Season of
our children, our Fathers the French formerly used to
credit his Children for powder &amp; lead to hunt with, I
request in behalf of all the Nations present that you will
speak to the Traders now here to do the same, my Father,
once more I request you will take pity on us &amp; tell your
Traders to give your Children credit for a little powder &amp;
lead, as the support of our Family’s depend upon it, we
have told you where we live, that whenever you want us &amp;
let us know it, we will come directly to you.—A Belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span>: You stoped up the Rum Barrel when we
came here, ’till the Business of this Meeting<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> was over,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
as it is now finished, we request you may open the barrel
that your Children may drink &amp; be merry.</p>

<p>August 29ᵗʰ—A Deputation of several Nations sett
out from Detroit for the Ilinois Country with several
Messages from me &amp; the Wyondats, Six Nations, Delawares,
Shawanese &amp; other Nations, in answer to theirs
delivered me at Ouiatonon.</p>

<p>30ᵗʰ—The Chiefs of the several Nations who are settled
on the Ouabache returned to Detroit from the River
Roche, where they had been encamped, &amp; informed
Colᵒ Campbell &amp; me, they were now going off for their
own Country, &amp; that nothing gave them greater pleasure,
than to see that all the Western Nations &amp; Tribes had
agreed to a general Peace, &amp; that they should be glad [to
know] how soon their Fathers the English, would take
possession of the Posts in their Country, formerly possessed
by their late Fathers the French, to open a
Trade for them, &amp; if this could not be done this Fall,
they desired that some Traders might be sent to their
Villages to supply them for the Winter, or else they
would be oblidged to go to the Ilinois and apply to their
old Fathers the French for such necessarys as they might
want.</p>

<p>They then spoke on a Belt &amp; said Fathers, every thing
is now settled, &amp; we have agreed to your taking possession
of the posts in our Country. We have been informed,
that the English where ever they settle, make the Country
their own, &amp; you tell us that when you conquered the
French they gave you this Country.—That no difference
may happen hereafter, we tell you now the French never
conquered us neither did they purchase a foot of our
Country, nor have they a right to give it to you, we gave
them liberty to settle for which they always rewarded us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
&amp; treated us with great Civility while they had it in their
power, but as they are become now your people, if you
expect to keep these Posts, we will expect to have proper
returns from you.—A Belt.</p>

<p>Septᵇʳ 2ᵈ—The chiefs of the Wyondatts or Huron, came
to me &amp; said they had spoke last Summer to Sir Willᵐ
Johnson at Niagara about the lands, on which the French
had settled near Detroit belonging to them, &amp; desired
I would mention again to him. They never had sold it
to the French, &amp; expected their new Fathers the English
would do them justice, as the French were become one
People with us.—A Belt.</p>

<p>4ᵗʰ—Pondiac with several chiefs of the Ottawas,
Chippawaes &amp; Potowatamies likewise complained that
the French had settled part of their country, which they
never had sold to them, &amp; hoped their Fathers the
English would take it into Consideration, &amp; see that a
proper satisfaction was made to them. That their
Country was very large, &amp; they were willing to give up
such part of it, as was necessary for their Fathers the
English, to carry on Trade at, provided they were paid
for it, &amp; a sufficient part of the Country left them to hunt
on.—A Belt.</p>

<p>6ᵗʰ—The <i>Sagina</i> Indians came here,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> &amp; made a
speech on a Belt of Wampum expressing their satisfaction
on hearing that a general Peace was made with all
the Western Nations &amp; with Pondiac, they desired a
little Powder, Lead &amp; a few knives to enable them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
hunt on their way home, &amp; a little rum to drink their new
Fathers health.—A Belt.</p>

<p>9ᵗʰ—<i>Altewaky</i> and <i>Chamindiway</i> Chiefs of a Band
of Ottawas from Sandusky with 20 Men came here and
informed me that their late conduct had been peaceable,
that on hearing there was a great Meeting of all Nations
at this place, they came to hear what would be done, &amp;
on their way here they had been informed that a General
Peace was settled with all Nations to the Sun setting, &amp;
they now came to assure us of their attachment to the
English Interest, &amp; beged for some Powder, Lead,
some Blankets and a little rum to help them to return to
their town. A String.</p>

<p>Septbr 11ᵗʰ—Colᵒ Campbell &amp; I gave the above parties
some presents &amp; a little rum &amp; sent them away well
satisfied.</p>

<p>12ᵗʰ—The Grand Sautois<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> came with his band and
spoke as follows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span>: You sent me a Belt from the Miamis, &amp;
as soon as I received it, I set off to meet you here, on my
way I heard what had past between you &amp; the several
Tribes that met you here, you have had pity on them, &amp;
I beg in behalf of myself &amp; the people of Chicago that
you will have pity on us also. ’tis true we have been
Fools, &amp; have listened to evil reports, &amp; the whistling
of bad birds, we red people, are a very jealous and foolish
people, &amp; Father amongst you White People, there are
bad people also, that tell us lyes &amp; deceive us, which has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
been the occasion of what has past, I need not say much
on this head, I am now convinced, that I have been
wrong for some years past, but there are people who
have behaved worse than I &amp; my people, they were pardoned
last year at this place, I hope we may meet with
the same, that our Women &amp; Children may enjoy the
blessings of peace as the rest of our Bretheren the red
people, &amp; you shall be convinced by our future conduct
that we will behave as well as any Tribe of Indˢ in this
Country.—A Belt.</p>

<p>He then said that the St. Joseph Indians would have
come along with him, but the English Prisoner which
their Fathers want from them, was some distance off a
hunting, &amp; as soon as they could get him in, they would
deliver him up and desire forgiveness.</p>

<p>14ᵗʰ—I had a private meeting with the grand Sautois
when he told me he was well disposed for peace last Fall,
but was then sent for to the Ilinois, where he met with
Pondiac, &amp; that then their Fathers the French told
them, if they would be strong to keep the English out of
possession of that Country but this Summer, That the
King of France would send over an Army next Spring, to
assist his Children the Indians, and that the King of
Spain would likewise send troops to help them to keep
the English out of their Country, that the English were a
bad people, &amp; had a design to cut off all the Indian
Nations in this Country, &amp; to bring the Southern Indians
to live &amp; settle there, this account made all the Indians
very uneasy in their minds, &amp; after holding a Council
amongst themselves, they all determined to oppose the
English, &amp; not to suffer them to take Possession of the
Ilinois, that for his part he behaved as ill as the rest to
the English Officers that came there in the Spring, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
since he had been better informed of the goodness of the
English, &amp; convinced the French had told lyes for the
love of their Beaver, he was now determined with all his
people to become faithfull to their new Fathers the English,
&amp; pay no regard to any stories the French should
tell him for the future.</p>

<p>Sepʳ 15ᵗʰ—Colᵒ Campbell &amp; I had a meeting with
the Grand Sautois, at which we informed him of every
thing that had past with the several Nations &amp; Tribes &amp;
told him that we accepted him and his people in Friendship,
&amp; would forgive them as we had the rest of the
Tribes, &amp; forget what was past provided their future
conduct should convince us of their sincerity, after which
we gave them some presents, for which he returned
thanks &amp; departed very well satisfied.</p>

<p>19ᵗʰ—I received a letter by express from Colᵒ Reed
acquainting me of Capt Sterlings setting out from Fort
Pitt, with 100 men of the 42ᵈ Regᵗ to take possession of
Fort Chartres in the Ilinois Country.</p>

<p>20ᵗʰ—I sent of[f] Huron Andrew Express to Capᵗ
Sterling<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> at the Ilinois, &amp; with messages to the several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
Nations in that Country &amp; those on the Ouabache, to
acquaint them of Capᵗ Starling’s departure from Fort
Pitt for the Ilinois Country.</p>

<p>25ᵗʰ—The Chiefs of the Sᵗ Joseph Indians arrived
and addressed themselves to Colᵒ Campbell &amp; me as
follows,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fathers</span>: We are come here to see you, altho’ we
are not acquainted with you, we had a Father formerly,
with whom we were very well acquainted, &amp; never differed
with him, you have conquered him some time ago, &amp;
when you came here first notwithstanding your hands
were all bloody, you took hold of us by the hands, &amp;
used us well, &amp; we thought we should be happy with our
Fathers, but soon an unlucky difference happened, which
threw us all in confusion, where this arose we don’t
know but we assure you, we were the last that entered
into this Quarrel, the Indˢ from this place solicited us
often to join them, but we would not listen to them, at
last they got the better of our foolish young Warriors,
but we never agreed to it, we knew it would answer no
end, &amp; often told our Warriors they were fools, if they
succeeded in killing the few English in this Country, they
could not kill them all because we knew you to be a great
People.</p>

<p>Fathers: you have after all that has happened, received
all the several Tribes in this Country for your
Children, we from St. Joseph’s seem to be the last of
your Children that come to you, we are no more than
Wild Creatures to you Fathers in understanding therefore
we request you’l forgive the past follies of our young
people &amp; receive us for your Children since you have
thrown down our former Father on his back, we have been
wandering in the dark like blind people, now you have dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
all this darkness which hung over the heads of the
several Tribes, &amp; have accepted them for your Children,
we hope you will let us partake with them of the light,
that our Women &amp; Children may enjoy Peace, &amp; we
beg you’l forget all that is past, by this belt we remove all
evil thoughts from your hearts.—A Belt.</p>

<p>Fathers, When we formerly came to visit our late
Fathers the French they always sent us home joyfull, &amp;
we hope you will have pity on our Women &amp; Young Men
who are in great Want of necessarys, &amp; not let us return
home to our Villages ashamed.</p>

<p>Colᵒ Campbell &amp; I made them the following answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children</span>: I have heard with attention what you
have said, &amp; am glad to hear that you have delivered up
the Prisoners at Michillimakinac, agreeable to my desire,
as the other Prisoner who I always thought belonged to
your Nation does not, but the man who has him resides
now in your Country, I must desire you’l do every thing
in your Power to get him brought to me, nothing will give
me greater pleasure than to promote the good Works of
Peace, &amp; make my Children the Indians happy as long
as their own Conduct shall deserve it. I did not know
what to think of your conduct for some time past, but to
convince you of my sincere desire to promote Peace, I
receive you as Children as I have done the other Nations, &amp;
hope your future Conduct may be such, as will convince
me of your sincerity.—A Belt.</p>

<p>Children: Sometimes bad people take the liberty of
stragling into your Country, I desire if you meet any such
people to bring them immediately here, likewise I desire
that none of your Young Men may steal any Horses out
of this settlement as they have done formerly, we shall
see always strict justice done to you, &amp; expect the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
from you, on that your own happiness depends, &amp; as
long as you continue to merit our friendship by good
actions in promoting Peace &amp; Tranquility between your
Young People &amp; His Majesties Subjects, you may expect
to be received here with open arms, &amp; to convince you
further of my sincerity, I give you some cloaths, powder,
lead, vermillion &amp; 2 cags of rum for your young People,
that you may return home without shame as you desired.</p>

<p>Children, I take this oppertunity to tell you that your
Fathers the English are gone down the Ohio from Fort
Pitt to take possession the Ilinois, &amp; desire you may
acquaint all your people of it on your return home, &amp; likewise
desire you will stop your Ears against the Whistling
of bad birds, &amp; mind nothing else but your Hunting to
support your Familys, that your Women &amp; Children
may enjoy the Blessing of Peace.—A Belt.</p>

<p><i>September 26th.</i><a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>—Set out from Detroit for Niagara;
passed Lake Erie along the north shore in a birch canoe,
and arrived the 8th of October at Niagara. The navigation
of the lake is dangerous for batteaux or canoes, by
reason the lake is very shallow for a considerable distance
from the shore. The bank, for several miles, high
and steep, and affords a harbor for a single batteau. The
lands in general, between Detroit and Niagara, are high,
and the soil good, with several fine rivers falling into the
lake. The distance from Detroit to Niagara is computed
three hundred miles.</p>

They spread over a large tract of country, and have forty odd villages;
in which country are several other tribes of Indians, who are tributaries
to the La Sues, none of whom except a very few, have ever known the
use of fire-arms: as yet but two villages. I suppose the French don’t
choose to risk a trade among such a powerful body of people, at so vast a
distance.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Croghan to Sir William Johnson</span><a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> In the scituation I was in at Ouiatonon, with
great numbers of Indians about me, &amp; no Necessaries
such as Paper &amp; Ink, I had it not in my power to take
down all the speeches made by the Indian Nations, nor
what I said to them, in so particular a manner as I could
wish, but hope the heads of it as I have taken down will
meet with your approbation.</p>

<p>In the Course of this Tour through the Indⁿ Countrys
I made it my study to converse in private with Pondiac, &amp;
several of the Chiefs of the different Nations, as often as
oppertunity served, in order to find out the sentiments
they have of the French &amp; English, Pondiac is a shrewd
sensible Indian of few words, &amp; commands more respect
amongst those Nations, than any Indian I ever saw could
do amongst his own Tribe. He and all his principal men
of those Nations seem at present to be convinced that the
French had a view of interest in stirring up the late differance
between his Majesties Subjects &amp; them &amp; call it a
Bever War, for neither Pondiac nor any of the Indians
which I met with, ever pretended to deny but the French
were at the bottom of the whole, &amp; constantly supplyed
them with every necessary they wanted, as far as in their
power, every where through that Country &amp; notwithstanding
they are at present convinced, that it was for
their own Interest, yet it has not changed the Indians
affections to them, they have been bred up together like
Children in that Country, &amp; the French have always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
adopted the Indians customs &amp; manners, treated them
civily &amp; supplyed their wants generously, by which means
they gained the hearts of the Indians &amp; commanded
their services, &amp; enjoyed the benefit of a very large Furr
Trade, as they well knew if they had not taken this measure
they could not enjoy any of those Advantages. The
French have in a manner taught the Indians in that
Country to hate the English, by representing them in the
worst light they could on all occasion, in particular they
have made the Indians there believe lately, that the English
would take their Country from them &amp; bring the
<i>Cherokees</i> there to settle &amp; to enslave them, which report
they easily gave credit to, as the Southern Indˢ had
lately commenced war against them. I had great difficulty
in removeing this suspicion and convincing them of
the falsity of this report, which I flatter myself I have
done in a great measure, yet it will require some time, a
very even Conduct in those that are to reside in their
Country, before we can expect to rival the French in their
affection, all Indians are jealous &amp; from their high
notion of liberty hate power, those Nations are jealous
and prejudiced against us, so that the greatest care will
be necessary to convince them of our honest Intention by
our Actions. The French sold them goods much dearer
than the English Traders do at present, in that point we
have the advantage of the French, but they made that
up in large presents to them for their services, which they
wanted to support their Interest in the Country, &amp; tho’
we want none of their services, yet they will expect favours,
&amp; if refused look on it in a bad light, &amp; very likely
think it done to distress them for some particular Advantages
we want to gain over them. They are by no means
so sensible a People as the Six Nations or other Tribes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
this way, &amp; the French have learned them for their own
advantage a bad custom, for by all I could learn, they
seldom made them any general presents, but as it were fed
them with Necessaries just as they wanted them Tribe
by Tribe, &amp; never sent them away empty, which will
make it difficult &amp; troublesome to the Gentlemen that
are to command in their Country for some time, to please
them &amp; preserve Peace, as they are a rash inconsiderate
People and don’t look on themselves under any obligations
to us, but rather think we are obliged to them for
letting us reside in their Country. As far as I can judge
of their Sentiments by the several Conversations I have had
with them, they will expect some satisfaction made them
by Us, for any Posts that should be established in their
Country for Trade. But you will be informed better by
themselves next Spring, as Pondiac &amp; some Chiefs of
every Nation in that Country intend to pay you a visit.
The several Nations on the Ouiabache, &amp; towards the
<i>Ilinois</i>, <i>St. Josephs</i>, <i>Chicago</i>, <i>Labaye</i>, <i>Sagina</i> &amp; other
places have applyed for Traders to be sent to their settlements,
but as it is not in the power of any Officer to
permit Traders to go from Detroit or <i>Michillimackinac</i>,
either English or French, I am of opinion the Indˢ will
be supplyed this year chiefly from the <i>Ilinois</i>, which is
all French property &amp; if Trading Posts are not established
at proper Places in that Country soon the French
will carry the best part of the Trade over the <i>Missisipi</i>
which they are determined to do if they can, for I have
been well informed that the French are preparing to
build a strong trading Fort on the other side Missisipi,
about 60 miles above <i>Fort Chartres</i>,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and have this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>

496-498; also printed in <i>Early History of Western Pennsylvania</i>, app., pp. 21-29.
The circumstances under which it was written are as follows: In the
autumn of 1750, Conrad Weiser reported to the governor of Pennsylvania that
the French agent Joncaire was on his way to the Ohio with a present of goods,
and orders from the governor of Canada to drive out all the English traders.
Accordingly, Governor Hamilton detailed Croghan and Montour to hasten
thither, and by the use of a small present, and the promise of more, to try and
counteract the intrigues of the French, and maintain the Indians in the English
interest. Upon Croghan’s arrival at Logstown, he sent back this reassuring letter.
Proceeding westward to the Muskingum, where he had a trading house at a
Wyandot village, Croghan met Christopher Gist, agent for the Ohio Company,
and with him continued to the Scioto, thence to the Twigtwee town of Pickawillany
(near the present Piqua, Ohio). All the way, Croghan held conferences
with the Delawares, Shawnees, Wyandots, and Twigtwees, strengthening
the English alliance, and promising a large present of goods to be furnished
next spring at Logstown. At Pickawillany, he made an unauthorized treaty
with two new tribes who sought the English alliance—the Piankeshaws and
Weas (Waughwaoughtanneys, French Ouiatonons). Unfortunately no extant
document by Croghan adequately chronicles this journey. Our knowledge of
it is derived from the journal of Gist (<i>q. v.</i>); from incidental notices in the
<i>Pennsylvania Colonial Records</i>, v, pp. 476, 485-488, 522-525; and from Croghan’s

<p><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="label">[16]</a> Philippe Thomas Joncaire (John Cœur), Sieur de Chabert, was a French
officer resident among the Seneca Indians, to whose tribe his mother was said
to belong. Born in 1707, on the death of his father (1740) he succeeded to
the latter’s influence and authority among the Iroquois, and made constant
efforts to neutralize the influence of Sir William Johnson, the English agent.
Joncaire had a trading house at Niagara, and his profits from the portage of
goods at that place were great. He accompanied Céloron’s expedition in
1749; and in 1753 met Washington at Venango. It was chiefly due to his influence
that the Ohio Indians deserted the English at the outbreak of the French
and Indian war. Joncaire led the Iroquois contingent in all the campaigns on
the Allegheny and in Western New York; and when Prideaux and Johnson
advanced against Niagara, he commanded an outpost at the upper end of the
portage. He signed the capitulation of Fort Niagara (1759), but after that
nothing further is known of him.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="label">[18]</a> Detroit was considered an important station by La Salle; but no permanent
post was established there until 1701, when De la Mothe Cadillac built a
fort named Pontchartrain, and established the nucleus of a French colony.
Bands of Indians were induced to settle at the strait; and here (1712) took
place the battle of the Foxes with the Hurons and Ottawas. Detroit continued
to be one of the most important French posts in the West until in 1760,
when it was transferred to an English detachment under command of Major
Rogers. See <a href="#JOURNAL_CROGHAN">Croghan’s <i>Journal</i>, <i>post</i></a>.</p>

<p>The siege of Detroit during Pontiac’s War is one of the best known incidents
in its history. During the Revolution, the British officials here were
accused of sending scalping parties against the frontier settlements; and in
1779 George Rogers Clark captured at Vincennes its “hair-buying” commandant,
General Henry Hamilton. In 1780, an expedition against Detroit was
projected by Clark, but failed of organization. Throughout the Indian wars
of the Northwest, Detroit was regarded with suspicion by the Americans, and
its surrender in 1796 secured a respite for the frontier. Its capitulation to the
British by Hull (1812) was a blow to the American cause, which was not repaired
until after Perry’s victory on Lake Erie, when Proctor evacuated Detroit,
which was regained by an American force (September 29, 1813). Cass was
then made governor. As American settlement came in, the importance of
Detroit as a centre for the fur-trade declined, and its career as a Western commercial
city began.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">[19]</a> Captain William Trent was a noted Indian trader, brother-in-law and at
this time partner of Croghan. Although born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (1715),
he served the colony of Virginia as Indian agent; and in 1752 its governor dispatched
him to the Miamis with a present. See <i>Journal of Captain Trent</i>
(Cincinnati, 1871). The following year he was sent out by the Ohio Company
to begin a fortification at the Forks of the Ohio, from which in Trent’s absence
(April, 1754), the garrison was expelled by a French force under Contrecœur.
Trent was with Forbes in 1758, and the following year was made deputy Indian
agent, assistant to Croghan, and aided at the conferences at Fort Pitt in 1760.
His trade was ruined by the uprising of Pontiac’s forces, but he received reparation
at the treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) by a large grant of land between the
Kanawha and Monongahela rivers, where he made a settlement. At the outbreak
of the Revolution he joined the patriot cause, and was major of troops
raised in Western Pennsylvania.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

lawyer, and being himself educated for the legal profession, held several offices
in the colony before he was appointed lieutenant-governor in 1748. His administration
was a vigorous one, but owing to difficulties with the Quaker
party he resigned in 1754. Five years later he was reinstated in the office, and
served until the proprietor John Penn came over as governor (1763). His
death occurred at New York during the British occupation (1783).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

pp. 26-34. As the result of Croghan’s Western journey during the winter of
1750-51, and the desire of Pennsylvania to maintain its trade relations with
the Ohio Indians, the Assembly voted £700 to be employed in presents;
and the governor instructed Croghan and Montour to deliver the goods.—See
<i>Pennsylvania Colonial Records</i>, v, pp. 487, 518, 525, and <a href="#JOURNAL_CROGHAN">Croghan’s
account, <i>post</i></a>. The adroitness with which Croghan outwitted the French
officer and interpreter Joncaire, and his influence over the chiefs on the
Ohio, as well as the susceptibility of the Indian nature to the influence
of material goods, are all exemplified in this narrative. It did not result,
however, as Croghan and the governor wished, in inducing the Pennsylvania
authorities to construct a fort on the Ohio. The beginnings of that
enterprise were left to the Virginians, but too late to secure the Forks of the
Ohio from being seized by the French.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[22]</a> The commandant of this famous expedition (1749) was Pierre Joseph
Céloron, Sieur de Blainville, born in 1693, and having served a long apprenticeship
in the posts of the upper country. He commanded an invasion of the
Chickasaw country (1739), and had charge of the post at Detroit in 1742-43,
and again in 1750-54. Fort Niagara was entrusted to him in 1744-47, whence
he was transferred to Crown Point, until his Ohio expedition took place. In
the French and Indian War he held the rank of major, and served on the staff
of the commander-in-chief. He died about 1777. In 1760, the Canadian
authorities characterized him as “poor and brave.” Some question has
arisen, whether the leader of this expedition might not have been a younger
brother, Jean Baptiste. For Croghan’s visit to the Ohio directly after Céloron’s
expedition had passed, see <a href="#JOURNAL_CROGHAN"><i>post</i></a>; also, <i>Pennsylvania Colonial Records</i>, v,

to the commandants of the Western posts to arrest all British subjects found in
the Ohio Valley. La Jonquière, who was born in 1686, had served in the
French navy with distinction, and after his first commission as governor of
New France was captured by an English vessel (1747), and kept a prisoner for
more than a year, so that he did not reach his post until 1749. His term of

brothers who migrated from Ephrata about 1745, and ultimately settled on the
Monongahela about ten miles below Morgantown, West Virginia. The Dunkers
were a sect of German Baptists that arose in the Palatine about 1708, and migrated
to Pennsylvania in 1719. Their formal organization took place at a
baptism on the banks of Wissahickon Creek (near Philadelphia) in 1723.
There were several divisions of this sect, one of which founded the community
of Ephrata. Their tenets were baptism by immersion, a celibate community
life, and refusal to bear arms. The Eckerlin brothers sought a solitary wilderness
life, and at first were regarded with favor by the Ohio Indians. A massacre,
however, demolished their settlement in 1757. Three of the party were
captured, and sent as prisoners to Canada, and later to France. For details

(also found in <i>Early History of Western Pennsylvania</i>, app., pp. 50-53), and
chronicles a material change of affairs on the Ohio since the last account written
by Croghan. Then the English interests were in the ascendency, and the French
were being flouted and driven from the headwaters of the Ohio. But the division
in English councils, the supineness of the colonial assemblies, and the active
preparation and determined advance of the French into the upper Ohio Valley
had had its effect upon the Indian tribes. Two years before, Trent had reported
all the Ohio tribes secure in the English interest; but the same year an expedition
from Detroit had moved against the recalcitrant Miamis (Twigtwees),
and after inflicting a severe chastisement had secured them again to the French
control, as Croghan herein reports. Early the following year the French
expedition under Marin had advanced to take forcible possession of the Ohio
country, and begin the chain of posts necessary to its defense. Presqu’isle
and Le Bœuf had been built, while a deputation under Joncaire had seized
the English trader’s house at Venango, and placed a French flag above it. A
large number of the Indians, frightened at this show of force, yielded to the
threatenings and cajoleries of the French officers. A small party, hoping to
obtain aid from the English colonists, had sent off a deputation in the autumn
of 1753 to meet the Virginia authorities at Winchester, and those of Pennsylvania
at Carlisle, at both of which conferences Croghan was in attendance.
The present which the Assembly of Pennsylvania had voted the preceding May
(<i>Pennsylvania Colonial Records</i>, v, p. 617) was cautiously given out, most of it
consisting of powder and lead; it was feared with reason, that it might be used to
the disadvantage of the back settlements. Croghan himself, although using every
endeavor to fortify the Indians in the English alliance, lost heart at the dilatoriness
of the Pennsylvania Assembly, some of whose members even doubted whether
the land invaded did not rightfully belong to the French. He could wish with
all his “hart Some gentleman who is an Artist in Philadelphia, and whos Acount
wold be Depended on, whould have ye Curiosety to take a Journay in those
parts,” in order to prove to the province (by means of a map) that the lands
on which the French were building lay within their jurisdiction—(<i>Pennsylvania
Archives</i>, ii, p. 132). Meanwhile, Washington had been sent out by Dinwiddie
to summon the French to retire. Croghan, who reached this territory

on the Ohio.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

in which Croghan had a full share, had occurred on the Ohio. The governor of
Virginia had engaged him to act as interpreter in Colonel Washington’s army—see
“Dinwiddie Papers,” <i>Virginia Historical Collections</i> (Richmond, 1883-84),
i, p. 187—and he had been present at the affair of the Great Meadows. During
the period between this and Braddock’s expedition, Croghan had been
busily employed in bringing over as many Indians as possible to the English
cause, and he had led the Indian contingent to Braddock’s aid (see <a href="#JOURNAL_CROGHAN"><i>post</i></a>).
After the battle of the Monongahela, Croghan returned to his home at Aughwick
Creek, caring at his own expense for the few Indians who remained firm
in the English interest, and planning to defend his settlement by a stockade
fort. A bill for his relief (he had lost all of his trading equipment) passed

order of the government and named for General Shirley, commander-in-chief
of the British forces in North America. Governor Morris wrote, after a visit
to this fort in January, 1756, that seventy-five men were garrisoned therein

and governor of New Jersey, was born at Morrisania, New York, about 1700.
Having been educated for the law, he became chief-justice of New Jersey (1738),
a position held until his death in 1764. The Pennsylvania proprietors chose
him as lieutenant-governor to succeed Hamilton in 1754; during his term of
office he vigorously defended the province, but engaged in constant disputes
with the Quaker party in the Assembly. The annoyance arising from this
caused him to resign in 1756.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Ohio, with headquarters at the mouth of Beaver Creek. He was somewhat
half-hearted in the English service, but protested his desire to preserve the
alliance until after Braddock’s defeat, when he openly took the hatchet against
the English settlements. Post met him upon the Ohio in 1758, and secured
a conditional agreement to remain neutral; but after the English occupation
of the Forks of the Ohio, he retreated to the Muskingum, where a town was
named for him. He took part in the treaties with the English in 1760 and 1762;
but was one of the ring-leaders in the conspiracy of Pontiac (1763). After
Bouquet’s advance into his territory, he reluctantly made peace, and delivered
up his English prisoners. He died about 1770, having in his later years
passed under the influence of the Moravian missionaries, and become one of
their most eminent disciples.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Monongahela, Captain Dumas, who had distinguished himself at that engagement,
was made commandant. He was an officer of great ability, and while
he sent out parties against the frontier, his instructions to one subordinate
(Donville, captured in 1756) were to use measures “consistent with honor and
humanity.” Dumas was superseded in 1756 by De Ligneris, who remained in

as Governour of this Province till the defeat of General Braddock; all which
you may depend upon are facts, and will appear upon the records of Indian

<p>After Croghan had been commissioned captain by the Pennsylvania authorities,
“he continued in Command of one of the Companies he had raised, and
of Fort Shirley on the Western frontier about three months, during which
time he sent, by my direction, Indian Messengers to the Ohio for Intelligence,
but never procured me any that was very material, and having a dispute with
the Commissʳˢ about some accounts between them, in which he thought himself
ill-used; he resigned his commission, and about a month ago informed me

Governor Morris, July 5, 1756, in <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, ii, pp. 689, 690.)</p>

<p>Sir William Johnson, having more penetration than the Pennsylvania authorities
as to the value of Croghan’s services, immediately appointed him his
deputy, in which position he continued for several years. When he presented
himself to the governor’s council in Philadelphia, December 14, 1756, “the
Council knowing Mr. Croghan’s Circumstances was not a little surprised at
the Appointment, and desired to see his Credentials”—(<i>Pennsylvania Colonial

<p>Sir William Johnson was born in Ireland in 1715, came to New York at an
early age, and settled as a trader in the Mohawk Valley. He was adopted into
the Iroquois nation, and acquired power in their national councils, retaining
them in the English interest during the French and Indian War. After the
battle of Lake George, Johnson was rewarded with a baronetcy, and secured
the surrender of Niagara in 1759. From that time until his death in 1774, he
was occupied with Indian negotiations, chief of which was the treaty of Fort
Stanwix (1768).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="label">[50]</a> Christopher Gist was of English descent, and a native of Maryland. In
early life he removed to the frontiers of North Carolina, where he became so
expert in surveying and woodcraft, that he was employed for two successive
years by the Ohio Company in inspecting and surveying the Western country.
It was on his first journey (1750-51) that he encountered Croghan, when they
travelled together to Pickawillany (the Twigtwee town), and Gist continued
via the Scioto River and the Kentucky country back to Virginia. On
the second journey (1751-52), he explored the West Virginia region. His
most noted adventure was accompanying Major George Washington in
the autumn of 1753 to the French forts in Northwest Pennsylvania. Earlier
in the same year, Gist had made a settlement near Mount Braddock, Fayette
County, Pennsylvania, and under the auspices of the Ohio Company was enlisting
settlers for the region. Eleven came out in the spring of 1754, and a
stockade fort was begun. This was utilized during Washington’s campaign,
but burned by the French after the defeat at Great Meadows. Gist later
petitioned the Virginia House of Burgesses for indemnity, but his request was
rejected. Both Gist and his son served with Braddock as scouts, and after
his defeat, raised a company of militia to protect the frontiers. After serving
for a time as deputy Indian agent for the Southern Indians, he died in 1759,
either in South Carolina or Georgia. One of his sons was killed at the battle
of King’s Mountain (1780).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

an early age. Having settled within the territory in dispute between Maryland
and Pennsylvania, he became an aggressive leader of the forces of the former
and was arrested by the Pennsylvania sheriff of Lancaster, where he spent
several months in jail. Being released by an agreement between the proprietors
of the two colonies (1739), he moved westward, and became the first permanent
settler of Maryland beyond the mountains, taking up land at a deserted
Shawnee village now called Oldtown. An active member of the Ohio Company,
he was assisted by the Indian Nemacolin in blazing the first path west to the
Ohio (1752). After the defeat on the Monongahela, Cresap moved back to
the settlements on Conococheague Creek; but on the return of peace sought his
former location, where he became a noted surveyor and frontiersman. His
son Michael was likewise a well-known borderer and Indian fighter. For a

<p><a id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="label">[60]</a> The years between the last document (1757) and the commencement of this
journey (October 21, 1760) had been eventful ones for the future of American
history. The French and Indian War, which until the close of 1757 had
resulted only in a series of disasters to the English, was pursued with greater
vigor when a change of administration sent able officers and leaders to America.
The evacuation of Fort Duquesne (1758), the capture of Niagara and Quebec
(1759), and the final capitulation of all Canada at Montreal (1760) gave the
mastery of the continent to the English, and opened the portals of the West.
Croghan was occupied during these momentous years with Indian negotiations
of great importance. As deputy of Sir William Johnson, he endeavored to
hold the Six Nations firm in their alliance, to pacify the frontier tribes, and
finally to announce to the expectant savages the English victory, and their
transfer to British authority. In 1757, he was employed in making peace with
the Susquehanna Indians (<i>Pennsylvania Colonial Records</i>, vii, pp. 517-551,
656-714; <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, iii, pp. 248, 319; <i>New York Colonial Documents</i>,
vii, pp. 321-324); and made a journey to Fort Loudoun, in Tennessee
to sound the disposition of the Cherokees—(<i>Pennsylvania Colonial Records</i>
vii, pp. 600, 630). His influence was relied upon to pave the way for Forbes’s
army (1758), and he was present at the important treaty at Easton, in October
of this year—(<i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, iii, p. 429; <i>Pennsylvania Colonial
Records</i>, viii, pp. 175-223; Stone, <i>Life of Sir William Johnson</i>, ii, p. 389).
Croghan also accompanied Forbes’s expedition, and assisted in pacifying the
Allegheny Indians. The journal in <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, iii, pp. 560-563,
designated as <i>Journal of Frederick Post from Pittsburgh, 1758</i>, is really Croghan’s
journal, as a comparison with Post’s journal for these dates will reveal. Early
in the next year we find Croghan at Fort Pitt, holding constant conferences
with Western Indians (<i>Pennsylvania Colonial Records</i>, viii, pp. 387-391; <i>Pennsylvania
Archives</i>, iii, pp. 671, 744), where he remained until ordered to join
the expedition sent out under Major Rogers to secure possession of Detroit
and other Western posts, included in the capitulation at Montreal. The diary
of this journey, which we here publish, is reprinted from <i>Massachusetts Historical
Collections</i>, 4th series, ix, pp. 362-379. Other letters of Croghan’s are
found in the same volume, pp. 246-253, 260, 266, 283-289. These all relate
to Indian affairs, and the information being brought in by his scouts and messengers
of conditions in the country lying westward—of the agitation, alarm,
and confusion among the Indian hostiles, who were eager to give in their
allegiance to their conquering English “brothers.” This journal of the voyage
to Detroit admirably supplements that of Major Robert Rogers, commandant
of the party which Croghan accompanied, whose account has been the standard
authority. It was published in Dublin, 1770, and several reprints have been
issued, the best of which is that edited by Hough, <i>Rogers’s Journals</i>, 1755-1760

<p><a id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104" class="label">[61]</a> Major Robert Rogers, the noted partisan leader, was born in New Hampshire.
On the outbreak of the French and Indian War he raised a company
of scouts known as “Rogers’s Rangers,” who did great service on the New
York frontier. After receiving the surrender of Detroit and attempting in vain
to reach Mackinac, he was again sent to Detroit to relieve the garrison in
Pontiac’s War, after which he proceeded against the Cherokees in the South.
About this time he was retired on half pay, and visited England, where he
published his journals, and a <i>Concise Account of North America</i>. In 1766, he
was assigned to the command of the important post of Mackinac, and there
schemed to betray the fort to the Spaniards. The plot having been discovered,
he was tried in Montreal, but secured an acquittal, when he visited England
a second time, only to be thrown into prison for debt. During the Revolution
he led a body of Loyalists, and having been banished from New Hampshire
retired to England (1780), where he died about 1800.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="label">[62]</a> Fort Presqu’ Isle was built by the French expedition under Marin in
the spring of 1753, on the site of the present city of Erie, Pennsylvania. It
was a post of much importance in maintaining the communication between
Niagara, Detroit, and the Forks of the Ohio. After the fall of Fort Duquesne
at the latter site (1758), a large garrison was collected at Fort Presqu’ Isle,
and a movement to re-possess the Ohio country was being organized, when
the capture of Niagara (1759) threw the project into confusion. Johnson sent
out a party to relieve the French officer at this place, and a detachment of the
Royal Americans commanded by Colonel Henry Bouquet advanced from Fort
Pitt and took possession of the stronghold. The fort was captured by Indians
during Pontiac’s conspiracy (June 17, 1763), as graphically related by Parkman.
After this uprising, a British detachment controlled the place until the
final surrender of the posts to the United States in 1796. Within the same
year, General Anthony Wayne, returning from his fruitful campaign against
the Indians, died in the old blockhouse of the fort. Some remains of the
works are still to be seen at Erie.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

in 1759. After accompanying this expedition to Detroit (1760), he was left
in command of that post (see letter from Campbell, <i>Massachusetts Historical
Collections</i>, 4th series, ix, p. 382), and when superseded by Major Gladwin
remained as lieutenant-commander. Leaving the fort on an embassy, during
the Pontiac uprising (1763), he was treacherously seized, made captive, and
cruelly murdered by the Indian hostiles. See Parkman, <i>Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>

<p><a id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107" class="label">[64]</a> Marin’s expedition (1753), that erected forts Presqu’ Isle and Le Bœuf,
intended to plant a fort at Venango, at the junction of French Creek with the
Allegheny; the first detachment sent out for that purpose was, however, repulsed
by the Indians. When Washington visited the place (December, 1753), he
found the French flag flying over the house of an English trader, Frazier, who
had been driven from the spot. The following year, the French built an outpost
on this site, and named it Fort Machault. When Post passed by here in
1758, he found it garrisoned by but six men and a single officer; see <a href="#JOURNAL_POST_I"><i>post</i></a>.
The French abandoned Fort Machault in 1759, and early the following spring
the English built Fort Venango, about forty rods nearer the mouth of the creek.
At the outbreak of Pontiac’s War, the latter fort was commanded by Lieutenant
Gordon, and he with all the garrison were captured, tortured, and
murdered by Indian foes. No fort was rebuilt at this place until late in the
Revolution, when Fort Franklin was erected for the protection of the border,
being garrisoned from 1788-96. The present town of Franklin was laid out
around the post in 1795.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_108" href="#FNanchor_108" class="label">[65]</a> The French Fort Le Bœuf (technically, “Fort de la Rivière aux Bœufs”)
was built by Marin (1753) on a creek of the same name, at the site of the present
town of Waterford, the terminus of the road which Marin caused to be constructed
south from Presqu’ Isle. This was the destination of Washington’s
expedition in 1753, and here he met the French commandant, Legardeur de
St. Pierre. The fort at this place was farmed out to a French officer, who
superintended the portage of provisions from Lake Erie to the Ohio. Post
found it garrisoned by about thirty soldiers in 1758; see <a href="#JOURNAL_POST_I"><i>post</i></a>. The following
year, after the French had abandoned it, a detachment of the Royal Americans
went forward from Fort Pitt to occupy this stronghold; and three years later
Ensign Price was beleaguered therein by the Indians, and barely escaped with
his life after a brave but futile defense. The Indians destroyed Fort Le Bœuf
by fire, and it was never rebuilt. In 1794, another fort with the same name
was erected near the old site, and garrisoned until after the War of 1812-15.
Subsequently the structure was used as a hotel, until accidentally burned in
1868.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

and was stationed at Halifax, being appointed governor of Nova Scotia (1754-56).
After being transferred to the Royal Americans (1757), he was at the siege
of Louisburg in 1758, and the following year was made second in command
for the capture of Quebec. Promoted for gallant services, he was placed in
control of the Western department, and had headquarters at Fort Pitt, where
Rogers had been detailed to seek him for orders with reference to the latter’s
Western expedition. General Monckton was military governor of New York
City, 1761-63. During that time he made an expedition to the West Indies,
and captured Martinique. Returning to England he was made governor of
Berwick (1766), and later of Portsmouth, which he represented in Parliament.

Pitt, at the beginning of the expedition; after the capitulation of Detroit, he
sent the larger portion of the Rangers back to Niagara under Brewer’s command.

<p><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="label">[68]</a> The topography of this voyage is a disputed question. Croghan is the
only contemporary authority who gives details. Siney Sipey is probably the
present Conneaut Creek, about twenty miles from Presqu’ Isle. Rogers says
“by night we had advanced twenty miles.” “Sinissippi” is frequently used
for Stoney or Rock Creek; the present Rock River, Illinois, claims that for its
Indian title. In 1761, Sir William Johnson describes this place (without
naming it) as follows: “Encamped in a very good creek and safe harbor.
The creek about fifty yards wide, and pretty deep; two very steep hills at the
entrance thereof, and the water of it of a very brown color.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="label">[69]</a> Rogers in his <i>Journal</i> places this meeting with the Ottawas on the seventh
instead of the fifth of November, and locates it at “Chogage” River (formerly
supposed to be Cuyahoga, but now thought to be Grand River). Croghan’s
account is more detailed, and probably written at the time; while Rogers’s
was written or revised later. “Wajea Sipery” is probably Ashtabula Creek,
which is sufficiently crooked in its course to make this name appropriate.
This is the traditional meeting for the first time, with Pontiac, the Ottawa
chief. Parkman’s well-known account of the haughty bearing and dignified
demands of this great Indian contrast markedly with Croghan’s simpler and
more literal account. In truth, it may be doubted whether this chief was
Pontiac at all, as he here speaks of himself as an old man. Rogers’s <i>Journal</i>
makes no mention of any chief, and alludes but incidentally to meeting the
Ottawa band; but in his <i>Concise Account of North America</i>, published in
London (1765), when the exploits of Pontiac were causing much attention,
Rogers represents himself as having encountered that chief on his way to
Detroit, and that the latter asked him how he dared to enter that country without
his (Pontiac’s) leave. This was probably a flight of the imagination, consequent
upon his representing the Indian chief as the hero of the tragedy in the
verses he was then preparing, known as <i>Ponteach, or the Savages of America</i>
(London, 1766). See Parkman, <i>Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>, i, p. 165, ii, appendix
B. The plain, unadorned account of Croghan, and the begging attitude of
the Ottawa chief, are probably more in accordance with historical verity than
Parkman’s and Rogers’s more romantic accounts.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113" class="label">[70]</a> The creek which Croghan calls “Onchuago” was Grand River, whose
Indian name was “Chaeaga” (Sheauga), and which is thus designated on
Evans’s map of 1755, and Hutchins’s map of 1778. Whittlesey, <i>Early History

about ten years of age emigrated with his father to Detroit. Entering the
army, he held a number of commands—in Acadia (1745-46), and at the
Western posts, especially at St. Josephs, where he had much influence over the
Indians. In the Huron revolt (1748), his bravery was especially commended.
During the French and Indian War he led his Indian allies on various raids—one
to Carolina in 1756, where he received a slight wound; and again in New
York against the German Flats (1757). Bellestre was present at Niagara
about the time it was attacked; but Pouchot detailed him to retire with the
detachments from forts Presqu’ Isle and Machault to Detroit, and he was
commanding at this post when summoned to surrender to Major Rogers.
After the capitulation of Detroit, he returned to Canada, and became a partisan
of the British power, captured St. John, and defended Chambly against the
Americans in 1775-76. He was made a member of the first legislative council
of the province.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

led to the relief of Niagara (1759). There he was captured and kept a prisoner

<p>General Jeffrey Amherst was an English soldier of much distinction, who
after serving a campaign in Flanders and Germany, was commissioned by
Pitt to take charge of the military operations in America (1758). His first
success was the capture of Louisburg, followed by the campaign of 1759, when
he reduced Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and moved upon Montreal, which
capitulated the following year. He was immediately made governor-general
of the British in North America, received the thanks of Parliament, and was
presented with the order of the Bath. It was in obedience to his orders that
Rogers undertook this westward expedition. Amherst’s later career was a
succession of honors, emoluments, and high appointments in the British army.
He opposed the cause of the colonies during the American Revolution. Late
in life he was field-marshal of the British army, dying (1797) at his estate in

command in Louisiana, where he remained nine years, until appointed governor
of New France, just before the outbreak of the French and Indian War. As
the last French governor of Canada, his term of service was embittered by
quarrels with the French generals, and disasters to French arms. After his
capitulation at Montreal, he went to France, only to be arrested, thrown into
the Bastile, and tried for malfeasance in office. He succeeded in securing an

<p><a id="Footnote_128" href="#FNanchor_128" class="label">[85]</a> The French fort of St. Josephs was established early in the eighteenth
century, on the right bank of the river of that name, about a mile from the
present city of Niles, Michigan. Its commandant was the “farmer” of the
post—that is, he was entitled to what profits he could win from the Indian
trade, and paid his own expenses. After the British took possession of this
fort, it was garrisoned by a small detachment of the Royal Americans. When
Pontiac’s War broke out, but fourteen soldiers were at the place, with Ensign
Schlosser in command. The fort was captured and eleven of the garrison
killed, the rest being carried prisoners to Detroit. During the Revolution,
Fort St. Josephs was three times taken from the British—twice by parties
from the Illinois led by French traders (in 1777, and again in 1778); and in
1781, a Spanish expedition set out from St. Louis to capture the stronghold,
and take possession of this region for Spain. See Mason, <i>Chapters from
Illinois History</i> (Chicago, 1901). The United States failed to garrison St.
Josephs when the British forts were surrendered in 1796, and built instead
(1804) Fort Dearborn at Chicago.</p>

<p>Ouiatonon (Waweoughtannes) was situated at the head of navigation on
the Wabash River, not far from the present city of Lafayette, Indiana. The
French founded this post about 1719, among a tribe of the same name (called
Weas by the English); and kept an officer stationed there until its surrender
to the English party sent out by Rogers (1761). The small garrison under
command of Lieutenant Jenkins was captured at the outbreak of Pontiac’s
conspiracy; but through the intervention of French traders their lives were
spared, while the fort was destroyed by burning, and never rebuilt. See Craig,
“Ouiatonon,” Indiana Historical Society <i>Collections</i> (Indianapolis, 1886),

<p><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="label">[87]</a> The French fort among the Miamis (English, Twigtwees) was situated
on the Maumee River, near the present site of Fort Wayne. The date of its
founding is in doubt; but the elder Vincennes was there in 1704, and soon
after this frequent mention is made of its commandants. During the revolt
of the French Indians (1748), the fort was partially burned. When Céloron
passed, the succeeding year, he described it as in a bad condition, and located
on an unhealthful site. About this time, the Miamis removed to the Great
Miami River, and permitted the English to build a fortified trading house at
Pickawillany. But an expedition sent out from Detroit chastised these recalcitrants,
and brought them back to their former abode, about Fort Miami—which
latter is described (1757) as protected with palisades, on the right bank
of the river. The garrison of the Rangers sent out by Rogers from Detroit
to secure this post, was later replaced by a small detachment of the Royal
Americans, under command of Lieutenant Robert Holmes, who notified Gladwin
of Pontiac’s conspiracy, but nevertheless himself fell a victim thereto.
See <a href="#JOURNAL_MORRIS">Morris’s <i>Journal</i>, <i>post</i></a>. The fort destroyed at this time was not rebuilt.
Croghan (1765) speaks of it as ruinous. In the Indian wars of the Northwest,

<p><a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="label">[91]</a> The manuscript of the journal that we here reprint came into the possession
of George William Featherstonhaugh, a noted English geologist who came
to the United States in the early nineteenth century and edited a geological
magazine in Philadelphia. He first published the document therein (<i>The
Monthly Journal of American Geology</i>), in the number for December, 1831.
It appeared again in a pamphlet, published at Burlington, N. J. (no date); and
Mann Butler thought it of sufficient consequence to be introduced into the
appendix to his <i>History of Kentucky</i> (Cincinnati and Louisville, 2nd ed., 1836).
Another version of this journey (which we may call the official version), also
written by Croghan, was sent by Sir William Johnson to the lords of trade, and
is published in <i>New York Colonial Documents</i>, vii, pp. 779-788. Hildreth published
a variant of the second (official) version “from an original MS. among
Colonel Morgan’s papers,” in his <i>Pioneer History of the Ohio Valley</i> (Cincinnati,
1848). The two versions supplement each other. The first was evidently written
for some persons interested in lands in the Western country—their fertility,
products, and general aspects; therefore Croghan herein confines himself to
general topographical description, and omits his journey towards the Illinois,
his meeting with Pontiac, and all Indian negotiations. The official report,
on the other hand, abbreviates greatly the account of the journey and the
appearance of the country, and concerns itself with Indian affairs and historical
events. We have in the present publication combined the two journals, indicating
in footnotes the important variations; but the bulk of the narrative is
a reprint of the Featherstonhaugh-Butler version.</p>

<p>With regard to the circumstances under which the official journal was
transcribed, Johnson makes the following explanation in his letter to the board
of trade (<i>New York Colonial Documents</i>, vii, p. 775): “I have selected the principal
parts [of this journal] which I now inclose to your Lordships, the whole of
his Journal is long and not yet collected because after he was made Prisoner, &amp;
lost his Baggage &amp;ca. he was necessitated to write it on Scraps of Paper procured
with difficulty at <i>Post Vincent</i>, and that in a disguised Character to prevent
its being understood by the French in case through any disaster he might be
again plundered.”</p>

<p>The importance of this journal for the study of Western history has frequently
been noted. Parkman used it extensively in his <i>Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>.
Winsor in his <i>Critical and Narrative History of America</i>, v, p. 704, <i>note</i>, first
pointed out in some detail the differences between the two versions. He errs,
however, in confusing the letters Croghan wrote from Vincennes and Ouiatonon.

went as far as Fort Chartres.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

river, one of his plates, which was found in 1798, and is now in possession of
the American Antiquarian Society, at Worcester, Massachusetts. Croghan
had frequently been on the Muskingum, where as early as 1750, he had a trading
house. The inhabitants at that time appear to have been Wyandots; but
after the French and Indian War the Delawares retreated thither, and built
their towns on the upper Muskingum. Later, the Moravian missionaries
removed their converts thither, and erected upon the banks of this river their
towns, Salem, Schönbrunn, and Gnadenhütten. In 1785, Fort Harmar was
placed at its mouth; and thither, three years later, came the famous colony of

the grant given to Trent, Croghan, and others at the treaty of Fort Stanwix
(1768) as a reparation for their losses in the previous wars. About the time
of Croghan’s visit, Captain Bull, a well-known Delaware Indian of New York,

Dunmore descended the Ohio with his flotilla, and disembarking at the river
with his army of regulars and frontiersmen—Clark, Cresap, Kenton, and
Girty among the number—marched overland to the Scioto, leaving Fort
Gower here to guard his rear. Signs of the earthwork of this fortification are

which is now in the museum of the Virginia Historical Society, at Richmond.
Gist surveyed here for the Ohio Company in 1752; later, Washington owned
ten thousand acres in the vicinity, and visited the spot in 1774. That same year,
the battle of Point Pleasant was fought at the mouth of the Kanawha by Colonel
Andrew Lewis’s division of Lord Dunmore’s army; and the succeeding year,
Fort Randolph was built to protect the frontiers. Daniel Boone retired hither

Jones to mean “hairy” river, from the multitude of deer’s hairs which floated
down the stream. The valley of the Scioto is famous in Western annals. During
the second half of the eighteenth century it was the chief seat of the Shawnees
whose lower, or “Shannoah,” town has been frequently mentioned in the Indian
transactions which we have printed. The Shawnees, on their withdrawal
up the valley, built the Chillicothe towns, where Pontiac’s conspiracy was largely
fomented. These were the starting point of many raids against the Kentucky
and West Virginia settlements. From these villages Mrs. Ingles and Mrs.
Dennis made their celebrated escapes in 1755 and 1763 respectively. During
all the long series of wars closing with Wayne’s victory in 1794, the intractable
Shawnees were among the most dreaded of the Indian enemy.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

who describe it in terms similar to those used by Croghan. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century, scientists took much interest in the remains of the
mammoth (or mastodon)—the “elephant’s bones” described by Croghan.
Thomas Jefferson and several members of the American Philosophical Society,
at Philadelphia, attempted to secure a complete skeleton of this extinct
giant; and a number of fossils from the lick were also sent to Europe. Dr.
Goforth of Cincinnati undertook an exploration to the lick at his own expense
(1803), but was later robbed of the result. The store of huge bones is not yet

as the Holston River. The latter is a branch of the Tennessee, flowing through
the mountains of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. Its valley was
early settled by Croghan’s friends, Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania. It is
probable that, as the Kentucky’s waters come from that direction, he had a
confused idea of the topography.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

ordered to explore as far as there in 1750, but did not reach the goal. Findlay
was there in 1753. Gordon gives an account similar to Croghan’s in 1766.
Ensign Butricke made more of an adventure in passing these falls—see <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, viii, p. 259. An attempt at a settlement was made by John
Connolly (1773); but the beginnings of the present city of Louisville are due
to the pioneers who accompanied George Rogers Clark thither in 1778, and
made their first home on Corn Island. For the early history of Louisville,

Highland Creek in Kentucky, between the mouths of the Green and Wabash
rivers.</p>

<p>The Wabash River was early considered by the French as one of the
most important highways between Canada and Louisiana. Marquette designates
it on his map as the Ouabouskiguo, which later Frenchmen corrupted
into Ouabache. The name was also applied to that portion of the Ohio below
the mouth of the Wabash; but James Logan in 1718 noted the distinction.
See Winsor, <i>Mississippi Basin</i>, p. 17. Croghan was probably the first Englishman
who had penetrated thus far into the former French territory, except
Fraser, who had preceded him to the Illinois.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Captain Louis St. Ange de Bellerive, was the son of a French officer who
came to Louisiana early in the eighteenth century, and commanded in the
Illinois country in 1722 and again in 1733. St. Ange had himself seen much
pioneer service, having been placed in charge of a fort on the Missouri (1736),
and having succeeded Vincennes at the post bearing the latter’s name. St.
Ange remained at Vincennes until summoned by De Villiers, commandant at
Fort Chartres, to supersede him there, and spare him the mortification of a
surrender to the English. After yielding Fort Chartres to Captain Sterling
(October, 1765), St. Ange retired to St. Louis, where he acted as commandant
(after 1766, in the Spanish service) until his death in 1774.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

about the Maumee and at Detroit. Charlevoix describes them (1721) as living
near Chicago. Being concerned in the Fox wars, they fled across the Mississippi;
and again, about the middle of the eighteenth century, were with the
Miamis on the Wabash, where they had a town near Fort Ouiatonon. They

<p><a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="label">[113]</a> The date of the founding of Vincennes (Post or Port Vincent) has been
varyingly assigned from 1702 to 1735; but Dunn, in his <i>Indiana</i> (Boston and
New York, 1888), p. 54, shows quite conclusively that François Margane,
Sieur de Vincennes, went thither at the request of Governor Périer of Louisiana
in 1727, and founded a fort to counteract the designs of the English against the
French trade. The French colony was not begun until 1735, and the next year
the commandant Vincennes was captured and burnt by the Chickasaws, while
engaged in an expedition against their country. Louis St. Ange succeeded to
the position of commandant at Vincennes, which he continued to hold until
1764, when summoned to the Illinois. He left two soldiers in charge at Vincennes,
of whom and their companions Croghan gives this unfavorable account.
No English officer appeared to take command at Vincennes until 1777; meanwhile
General Gage had endeavored to expel the French inhabitants therefrom
(1772-73). It is not surprising, therefore, that they received the Americans under
George Rogers Clark (1778), with cordiality; or that after Hamilton’s re-capture
of the place, they were unwilling to aid the English in maintaining the post
against Clark’s surprise (February, 1779), which resulted in the capture of
Hamilton and all the British garrison. After this event, Vincennes became
part of the Illinois government, until the organization of a Northwest Territory
in 1787.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

When George Rogers Clark invaded the Illinois country (1778), Maisonville

in America, and distinguished himself for his military services in the later
French wars. He was in the campaign against Louisburg (1745), and was
promoted for gallantry, and given the governorship of St. John’s, Newfoundland.
The outbreak of the French and Indian War found him at Oswego,
where with great bravery he drove the French back from an attack on a convoy
(1756). On the organization of the Royal Americans, Bradstreet became
lieutenant-colonel, and served with Abercrombie at Ticonderoga (1758). His
most renowned exploit was the capture, the same year, of Fort Frontenac,
which severed the connection between Canada and its Western dependencies.
After the close of the war, Bradstreet received a colonelcy. When the news
of Pontiac’s uprising reached the East, he was detailed to make an expedition
into the Indian territory by way of Lake Erie. His confidence in Indian promises
proved too great; he made peace with the very tribes who went murdering
and scalping along the frontiers as soon as his army had passed. Bradstreet
was made a major-general in 1772; but two years later, died in the city of New
York. The Indians whom Croghan found at Detroit were small bands from
the north and west, who had not received Bradstreet’s message, in time to

<p>Christian Frederick Post, author of the following
journals, was a simple, uneducated missionary of the
Moravian Church. His chief qualifications for the
perilous journeys herein detailed, were his intimate
acquaintance with Indian life and character, the belief
of the tribesmen in his truthfulness and honesty, and his
own steadfast courage and trust in the protection of a
higher power. Born in Polish Prussia in 1710, Post early
came under the influence of the Moravians, whose remarkable
missionary movement was just beginning to
germinate.</p>

<p>The first attempt of this church to christianize
the American Indians in Georgia having failed because
of Spanish hostility, the Moravian disciples removed
to Pennsylvania (1739), and were granted land on
which to establish their colony at Bethlehem. Thither
in 1742 came Post, eager to join in evangelizing the
Indians; for which purpose he was sent the following
year to assist Henry Rauch in his mission to the Mohegans
and Wampanoags. This mission had been established
about 1740, Count Zinzendorf, the great Moravian
bishop, having visited its site at Shekomeko (Pine Plains,
Dutchess County, New York) and baptized three Indians
as its first fruits. The work spread to the neighboring
Indian villages of Connecticut, and Post was assigned to
a circuit in Sharon Township, Litchfield County, consisting
of the villages of Pachgatgoch and Wechquadnach.
Here, in his zeal for the service, he married a converted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Indian woman (1743), and endeared himself to all
the tribe.</p>

<p>But persecutions began to assail the humble brethren
and their converts; they were accused of being papists,
arrested and haled before local magistrates, by whom
they were no sooner released than a mob of those whose
gain in pampering to Indian vices was endangered by
Moravian success, set upon them and rendered their lives
and those of their new converts intolerable. Post, who
had been on a journey to the Iroquois country (1745),
was arrested at Albany and sent to New York, where he
was imprisoned for seven weeks on a trumped-up charge
of abetting Indian raids.</p>

<p>The situation made retreat necessary; therefore, in
1746, the Shekomeko and Connecticut settlements were
broken up, and the Christian Indians with their missionaries
moved in detachments to Pennsylvania, where, after
kindly entertainment at Bethlehem, a town called Gnadenhütten
(huts of Grace), was built for them, at Weisport,
Carbon County. It was during their stay at Bethlehem
that Rachel, Post’s Indian wife, died (1747), and there
two years later he married a Delaware convert, Agnes,
who lived only until 1751.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Post was employed as missionary assistant,
going to Shamokin in 1747 to aid the missionary blacksmith
established there, to clear and plant more ground.
Again in 1749, he revisited the scene of his early labors,
and helped David Bruce to re-establish a mission among
the remnant left at Pachgatgoch. Two years later he
was summoned to a more distant field on the dismal
shores of Labrador, where a company of four Moravian
brethren were sent to begin a mission to the Eskimos.
An untoward accident rendered this project futile; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
major part of the crew of the vessel which had transported
them having been lost, the captain impressed the
missionaries to carry his ship back to England.</p>

<p>Thereupon Post again sought his home in Pennsylvania,
dwelling principally at Bethlehem, until called
upon by the Pennsylvania authorities to assist in public
affairs. There is no certain information of his introduction
to the managers of Indian matters in Pennsylvania;
but several Christian Indians from his flock had been
utilized as interpreters, and the Friendly Association of
Quakers, which was assuming so large a rôle in treating
with the natives, was well-inclined toward the Moravian
brothers.</p>

<p>The first mention of Post in the public records is in
connection with a message which he was employed to
carry (June, 1758) in conjunction with Charles Thomson
to Teedyuscung at Wyoming.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On his return to
the settlements, he was immediately commissioned to
go back to Wyoming with a message from the Cherokee
auxiliaries, who had come to join the army of Forbes,
and whose presence caused consternation among Pennsylvania’s
savage allies. With but five days’ respite, Post
again started on a journey beset with perils on every side,
through the wilderness of Northern Pennsylvania.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At
Teedyuscung’s cabin he met two Indians from the Ohio,
who declared that their tribes were sorry they had gone to
war against the English; they had often wished that messengers
from the government would come to them, for
then they should long before have abandoned war.</p>

<p>On the receipt of this important information, the council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
at Philadelphia debated to what use it might be put in
furthering the plans for Forbes’s advance. “Post was
desired to accompany the Indians, and he readily consented
to go.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Antiquarians and historians have alike admired the
sublime courage of the man, and the heroic patriotism
which made him capable of advancing into the heart of a
hostile territory, into the very hands of a cruel and
treacherous foe. But aside from Post’s supreme religious
faith, he had a shrewd knowledge of Indian customs, and
knew that in the character of an ambassador requested
by the Western tribes, his mission would be a source of
protection. Therefore, even under the very walls of Fort
Duquesne, he trusted not in vain to Indian good faith.</p>

<p>The results of this embassy were most gratifying. The
report of his mission coming during the important negotiations
at Easton, aided in securing the Indian neutrality
which made the advance of Forbes so much
less hazardous than that of Braddock.</p>

<p>But the work was only begun; and to complete it
Post’s renewed co-operation was necessary. This time
he was not to venture alone. Two militia officers,
Captain John Bull and Lieutenant William Hays, volunteered
for the service,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and having joined Post at Reading,
all proceeded with Indian companions in their van, to
overtake the army and reach the Ohio in advance of
the column.</p>

<p>Their mission was not in time to save the Indian
ferocity at Grant’s defeat; but it contributed to assure the
French that aid from the neighboring Indians was
dubious, and that in retreat lay their only safety.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Through the simple narrative of Indian speeches and
replies, one feels the intensity of the strain: the French
captain “looked as pale as death;” “we hanged out the
English flag, in spite of the French, on which our prisoners
folded their hands, in hopes that their redemption
was nigh.” Then the news came “which gave us the
pleasure to hear, that the English had the field, and that
the French had demolished and burnt the place entirely
and went off.”</p>

<p>Of Post’s later life and its vicissitudes, we get but scattered
glimpses. For the two years succeeding these adventurous
journeys, he served the Pennsylvania authorities
as messenger and interpreter, at the same time begging
to be allowed to go and preach to the newly-appeased
Indians on the Ohio. The last official act of Governor
Denny was the affixing of his signature to a passport for
Post, of whose loyalty, integrity and prudence he testifies
to have had good experience.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This desire to begin a mission to the Western Indians
was consummated in 1761, when Post proceeded alone
to the Muskingum and built the first white man’s
house within the present limits of Ohio. The following
spring, he applied to the Moravian brethren for
an assistant; whereupon John Heckewelder was assigned
to this service, and in his <i>Narrative</i> describes their
courteous reception by Bouquet at Fort Pitt, the restless
conditions among the Delawares and Shawnees,
and the warnings against the storm of fire and blood
which was so soon to break over the frontier. Heckewelder
retreated in due season; Post barely saved himself
by a sudden flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>In 1764, the ecclesiastical authorities saw fit to send
this intrepid missionary to the Mosquito Coast, where he
stayed two years, making a second visit in 1767. Toward
the close of his life he retired from the Moravian sect,
and entered the Protestant Episcopal Church. His
death occurred at Germantown in 1785.</p>

<p>The journal of the first tour to the Ohio Indians (July
15-September 22, 1758), was printed in the appendix to
<i>An Enquiry into the Causes of the Alienation of the Delaware
and Shawanese Indians from the British Interest</i>
(London, 1759; reprinted Philadelphia, 1867). This
book was published anonymously, but was known to be
the work of Charles Thomson, a prominent Philadelphia
Quaker, later secretary of the Continental Congress.
Thomson gives a brief preface to Post’s journal, and the
matter in the notes thereof is evidently by his hand; it
is probable that the notes to the second journal are also
by him. The first journal was reprinted by Proud,
<i>History of Pennsylvania</i> (Philadelphia, 1798), ii, appendix,
pp. 65-95, from which edition our reprint has been
made. Craig also published this in <i>The Olden Time</i>, i,
pp. 99-125, following almost verbatim the edition of
Thomson and Proud. Rupp, <i>Early History of Western
Pennsylvania</i> (Pittsburg and Harrisburg, 1846),
appendix, pp. 75-98, gives the same journal. The <i>Pennsylvania
Archives</i>, iii, pp. 520-544, also contains this
journal, evidently taken from the same manuscript, with
but slight variations in the spelling of proper names.</p>

<p>Heckewelder, <i>Narrative of the Mission of the United
Brethren</i> (Philadelphia, 1820), pp. 55, 56, says: “To
enumerate all the hardships, difficulties and dangers,
Frederick Post had been subjected to on these journies,
especially on the first, in the summer of the year 1758, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
at this time both impossible and needless. Suffice it to
say, that what <i>he</i> intended the public should know, was
published in the year after, in England, under the title
of ‘Christian Frederick Post’s Journal from Philadelphia
to the Ohio,’ &amp;c. His <i>original</i> manuscript journal,
however, which had for some time been placed in
the hands of the writer of this narrative, was far more
interesting, and evinced that few men would be found
able to undergo the fatigues of a journey, bearing so
hard on the constitution, or a mind to sustain such trials
of adversity—at least not with that calmness with which
Mr. Post endured it.”</p>

<p>The diary of the second journey of Christian Frederick
Post to the Ohio, October 25, 1758—January 8, 1759,
was first printed in London, 1759, for J. Wilkie; see
Field, <i>An Essay towards an Indian Bibliography</i> (New
York, 1873), p. 315. Proud, <i>History of Pennsylvania</i>,
ii, appendix, pp. 96-132, also reprints Post’s second journal,
and from this our reprint is made. It appears also
in <i>The Olden Time</i>, i, pp. 144-177; and in Rupp, <i>Early
History of Western Pennsylvania</i>, appendix, pp. 99-126.
The extract from a journal in the <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>,
iii, pp. 560-563, entitled “Journal of Frederick Post
from Pittsburg, 1758,” is in reality that of Croghan’s—see
<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>. For an example of the form and
spelling of the original manuscripts of these journals
before they were rigorously edited, see letter of Post’s in
<i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, iii, pp. 742-744. The following
is a sample extract therefrom:</p>

an examination of the foregoing inclines one not only to

OHIO, ON A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA TO THE
DELAWARE, SHAWNESE, AND MINGO INDIANS, SETTLED THERE.</h3>

</div>

<p><i>July the</i> 15th, 1758.—This day I received orders from
his honour, the Governor, to set out on my intended
journey, and proceeded as far as <i>German Town</i>, where I
found all the <i>Indians</i> drunk.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <i>Willamegicken</i> returned
to <i>Philadelphia</i>, for a horse, that was promised him.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>16th.—This day I waited for the said <i>Willamegicken</i>
till near noon, and when he came, being very drunk, he
could proceed no further, so that I left him, and went to
<i>Bethlehem</i>.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>17th.—I arrived at <i>Bethlehem</i>, and prepared for my
journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>18th.—I read over both the last treaties, that at
<i>Easton</i>, and that at <i>Philadelphia</i>, and made myself
acquainted with the particulars of each.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>19th.—With much difficulty I persuaded the <i>Indians</i>
to leave <i>Bethlehem</i>, and travelled this day no further
than <i>Hayes’s</i> having a hard shower of rain.</p>

<p>20th.—Arrived at fort <i>Allen</i>.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>21st.—I called my company together, to know if we
should proceed. They complained they were sick, and
must rest that day. This day, I think, <i>Teedyuscung</i><a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
laid many obstacles in my way, and was very much
against my proceeding: he said, he was afraid I should
never return; and that the Indians would kill me. About
dinner time two <i>Indians</i> arrived from <i>Wyoming</i>,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> with
an account that <i>Teedyuscung’s</i> son, <i>Hans Jacob</i>, was
returned, and brought news from the <i>French</i> and <i>Allegheny
Indians</i>. <i>Teedyuscung</i> then called a Council, and
proposed that I should only go to <i>Wyoming</i>, and return,
with the message his son had brought, to <i>Philadelphia</i>.
I made answer, that it was too late, that he should have
proposed that in <i>Philadelphia</i>; for that the writings containing
my orders were so drawn, as obliged me to go,
though I should lose my life.</p>

<p>22d.—I desired my companions to prepare to set out,
upon which <i>Teedyuscung</i> called them all together in the
fort, and protested against my going. His reasons were,
that he was afraid the <i>Indians</i> would kill me, or the
<i>French</i> get me; and if that should be the case he should
be very sorry, and did not know what he should do. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
gave for answer, “that I did not know what to think of
their conduct. It is plain, said I, that the <i>French</i> have a
<i>public road</i><a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to your towns, yet you will not let your own
flesh and blood, the <i>English</i>, come near them; which is
very hard: and if that be the case, the <i>French</i> must be
your masters.” I added, that, if I died in the undertaking,
it would be as much for the <i>Indians</i> as the <i>English</i>,
and that I hoped my journey would be of this
advantage, that it would be the means of saving the lives
of many hundreds of the <i>Indians</i>: therefore, I was resolved
to go forward, taking my life in my hand, as one ready to
part with it for their good. Immediately after I had
spoken thus, three rose up and offered to go with me the
nearest way; and we concluded to go through the inhabitants,
under the Blue mountains to fort <i>Augusta</i>, on
<i>Susquahanna</i>; where we arrived the 25th.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It gave me great pain to observe many plantations deserted
and laid waste; and I could not but reflect on the
distress, the poor owners must be drove to, who once
lived in plenty; and I prayed the Lord to restore peace
and prosperity to the distressed.</p>

<p>At fort <i>Augusta</i> we were entertained very kindly, had
our horses shod, and one being lame, we exchanged for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
another. Here we received, by <i>Indians</i> from <i>Diahogo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
the disagreeable news that our army was, as they said,
entirely cut off at <i>Ticonderoga</i>,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which discouraged one
of my companions, <i>Lappopetung’s</i> son, so much, that he
would proceed no further. <i>Shamokin Daniel</i> here asked
me, if I thought he should be satisfied for his trouble in
going with me. I told him every body, that did any
service for the province, I thought, would be paid.</p>

<p>27th.—They furnished us here with every necessary
for our journey, and we set out with good courage. After
we rode about ten miles, we were caught in a hard gust
of rain.</p>

<p>28th.—We came to <i>Wekeeponall</i>, where the road turns
off for <i>Wyoming</i>, and slept this night at <i>Queenashawakee</i>.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>29th.—We crossed the <i>Susquahanna</i> over the <i>Big
Island</i>. My companions were now very fearful, and this
night went a great way out of the road, to sleep without
fire, but could not sleep for the musquetoes and vermin.</p>

<p>30th &amp; 31st.—We were glad it was day, that we
might set out. We got upon the mountains, and had
heavy rains all night. The heavens alone were our
covering, and we accepted of all that was poured down
from thence.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 1st.—We saw three hoops<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> on a bush; to one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
of them there remained some long white hair. Our
horses left us, I suppose, not being fond of the dry food on
the mountains: with a good deal of trouble we found them
again. We slept this night on the same mountain.</p>

<p>2d.—We came across several places where two poles,
painted red, were stuck in the ground by the <i>Indians</i>, to
which they tye the prisoners, when they stop at night, in
their return from their incursions. We arrived this night
at <i>Shinglimuhee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> where was another of the same posts.
It is a disagreeable and melancholy sight, to see the means
they make use of, according to their savage way, to distress
others.</p>

<p>3d.—We came to a part of a river called <i>Tobeco</i>, over
the mountains, a very bad road.</p>

<p>4th.—We lost one of our horses, and with much difficulty
found him, but were detained a whole day on that
account.</p>

<p>I had much conversation with <i>Pisquetumen</i>;<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of which
I think to inform myself further when I get to my journey’s
end.</p>

<p>5th.—We set out early this day, and made a good long
stretch, crossing the big river <i>Tobeco</i>, and lodged between
two mountains. I had the misfortune to lose my pocket
book with three pounds five shillings,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and sundry other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
things. What writings it contained were illegible to
any body but myself.</p>

<p>6th.—We passed all the mountains, and the big river,
<i>Weshawaucks</i>, and crossed a fine meadow two miles in
length, where we slept that night, having nothing to eat.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>7th.—We came in sight of fort <i>Venango</i>, belonging to
the <i>French</i>, situate between two mountains, in a fork of
the <i>Ohio</i> river. I prayed the Lord to blind them, as he
did the enemies of <i>Lot</i> and <i>Elisha</i>, that I might pass unknown.
When we arrived, the fort being on the other
side of the river, we hallooed, and desired them to fetch
us over; which they were afraid to do; but shewed us a
place where we might ford. We slept that night within
half gun shot of the fort.</p>

<p>8th.—This morning I hunted for my horse, round the
fort, within ten yards of it. The Lord heard my prayer,
and I passed unknown till we had mounted our horses to
go off, when two <i>Frenchmen</i> came to take leave of the
<i>Indians</i>, and were much surprised at seeing me, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>By what I could learn of <i>Pisquetumen</i>, and the <i>Indians</i>,
who went into the fort, the garrison consisted of only six
men, and an officer blind of one eye.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> They enquired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
much of the <i>Indians</i> concerning the <i>English</i>, whether they
knew of any party coming to attack them, of which they
were apprehensive.</p>

<p>9th.—Heavy rains all night and day: we slept on
swampy ground.</p>

<p>10th.—We imagined we were near <i>Kushkushkee</i>; and
having travelled three miles, we met three <i>Frenchmen</i>,
who appeared very shy of us, but said nothing more than
to enquire, whether we knew of any <i>English</i> coming
against fort <i>Venango</i>.</p>

<p>After we travelled two miles farther, we met with an
<i>Indian</i>, and one that I took to be a runagade <i>English
Indian</i> trader; he spoke good <i>English</i>, was very curious
in examining every thing, particularly the silver medal
about Pisquitumen’s neck. He appeared by his countenance
to be guilty. We enquired of them where we
were, and found we were lost, and within twenty miles
of fort <i>Duquesne</i>. We struck out of the road to the right,
and slept between two mountains; and being destitute of
food, two went to hunt, and others to seek a road, but
to no purpose.</p>

<p>11th.—We went to the place where they had killed two
deers, and <i>Pisquetumen</i> and I roasted the meat. Two
went to hunt for the road, to know which way we should
go: one came back, and found a road; the other lost himself.</p>

<p>12th.—The rest of us hunted for him, but in vain; so,
as we could not find him, we concluded to set off, leaving
such marks, that, if he returned, he might know which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
way to follow us; and we left him some meat. We came
to the river <i>Conaquonashon</i> [Conequenessing Creek],
where was an old <i>Indian</i> town. We were then fifteen
miles from <i>Kushkushkee</i>.</p>

<p>There we stopt, and sent forward <i>Pisquetumen</i> with
four strings of <i>wampum</i> to apprize the town of our coming,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
with this message:</p>

<p>“Brother,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> thy brethren are come a great way, and
want to see thee, at thy fire, to <i>smoak that good tobacco</i>,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
which our good grandfathers used to smoak. Turn thy
eyes once more upon that road, by which I came.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> I
bring thee words of great consequence from the Governor,
and people of <i>Pennsylvania</i>, and from the king of
<i>England</i>. Now I desire thee to call all the kings and
captains from all the towns, that none may be missing.
I do not desire that my words may be hid, or spoken under
cover. I want to speak loud, that all the <i>Indians</i> may
hear me. I hope thou wilt bring me on the road, and
lead me into the town. I blind the <i>French</i>, that they may
not see me, and stop their ears, that they may not hear
the great news I bring you.”</p>

<p>About noon we met some <i>Shawanese</i>, that used to live at
<i>Wyoming</i>. They knew me, and received me very kindly.
I saluted them, and assured them the government of
<i>Pennsylvania</i> wished them well, and wished to live in
peace and friendship with them. Before we came to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
town, two men came to meet us and lead us in. King
Beaver shewed us a large house to lodge in.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The people
soon came and shook hands with us. The number was
about sixty young able men. Soon after king <i>Beaver</i>
came and told his people, “Boys, hearken, we sat here
without ever expecting again to see our brethren the
<i>English</i>; but now one of them is brought before you,
that you may see your brethren, the <i>English</i>, with your
own eyes; and I wish you may take it into consideration.”
Afterwards he turned to me and said,</p>

<p>“Brother, I am very glad to see you, I never thought
we should have had the opportunity to see one another
more; but now I am very glad, and thank God, who has
brought you to us. It is a great satisfaction to me.” I
said, “Brother, I rejoice in my heart, I thank God, who
has brought me to you. I bring you joyful news from
the Governor and people of <i>Pennsylvania</i>, and from your
children, the Friends:<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and, as I have words of great
consequence I will lay them before you, when all the kings
and captains are called together from the other towns. I
wish there may not be a man of them missing, but that
they may be all here to hear.”</p>

<p>In the evening king Beaver came again, and told me,
they had held a council, and sent out to all their towns,
but it would take five days before they could all come
together. I thanked him for his care. Ten captains
came and saluted me. One said to the others; “We
never expected to see our brethren the <i>English</i> again,
but now God has granted us once more to shake hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
with them, which we will not forget.” They sat by my
fire till midnight.</p>

<p>14th.—The people crowded to my house; it was full.
We had much talk. <i>Delaware George</i><a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> said, he had not
slept all night, so much had he been engaged on account
of my coming. The <i>French</i> came, and would speak
with me. There were then fifteen of them building houses
for the <i>Indians</i>. The captain is gone with fifteen to
another town. He can speak the <i>Indian</i> tongue well.
The <i>Indians</i> say he is a cunning fox; that they get a
great deal of goods from the <i>French</i>; and that the
French cloath the <i>Indians</i> every year, men, women and
children, and give them as much powder and lead as they
want.</p>

<p>15th.—<i>Beaver</i> king was informed, that <i>Teedyuscung</i>
had said he had turned the hatchet against the <i>French</i>,
by advice of the <i>Alleghany Indians</i>; this he blamed, as
they had never sent him such advice. But being informed
it was his own doing, without any persuasion of the
Governor, he was easy on that head. <i>Delaware Daniel</i>
prepared a dinner, to which he invited me, and all the
kings and captains; and when I came, he said, “Brother,
we are as glad to see you among us, as if we dined with
the Governor and people in Philadelphia. We have
thought a great deal since you have been here. We never
thought so much before.”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> I thanked them for their kind
reception; I said, it was something great, that God had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
spared our lives, to see one another again, in the old
brother-like love and friendship. There were in all
thirteen, who dined together.</p>

<p>In the evening they danced at my fire, first the men,
and then the women, till after midnight.</p>

<p>On the 16th, the king and captains called on me privately.
They wanted to hear what <i>Teedyuscung</i> had
said of them, and begged me to take out the writings. I
read to them what <i>Teedyuscung</i> had said, and told them,
as <i>Teedyuscung</i> had said he would speak so loud, that all
at <i>Allegheny</i>, and beyond should hear it, I would conceal
nothing from them. They said, they never sent any such
advice (as above mentioned), to <i>Teedyuscung</i>, nor ever
sent a message at all to the government,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and now the
<i>French</i> were here, their captain would come to hear, and
this would make disturbance. I then told them I
would read the rest, and leave out that part, and they
might tell the kings and captains of it, when they came
together.</p>

<p>17th.—Early, this morning they called all the people
together to clean the place, where they intended to hold
the council, it being in the middle of the town. <i>Kushkushkee</i>
is divided into four towns, each at a distance
from the others; and the whole consists of about ninety
houses, and two hundred able warriors.</p>

<p>About noon two public messengers arrived from the
<i>Indians</i> at fort <i>Duquesne</i> and the other towns. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
brought three large belts and two bundles of strings;<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
there came with them a <i>French</i> captain, and fifteen men.
The two messengers insisted that I should go with them
to fort <i>Duquesne</i>; that there were <i>Indians</i> of eight nations,
who wanted to hear me; that if I brought good news, they
inclined to leave off war, and live in friendship with the
<i>English</i>. The above messengers being <i>Indian</i> captains,
were very surly. When I went to shake hands with one
of them, he gave me his little finger; the other withdrew
his hand entirely; upon which I appeared as stout as
either, and withdrew my hand as quick as I could.
Their rudeness to me was taken very ill by the other captains,
who treated them in the same manner in their turn.</p>

<p>I told them my order was to go to the <i>Indian</i> towns,
kings and captains, and not to the <i>French</i>; that the <i>English</i>
were at war with the French, but not with those <i>Indians</i>,
who withdrew from the <i>French</i>, and would be at peace
with the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>King Beaver invited me to his house to dinner, and
afterwards he invited the <i>French</i> captain, and said before
the <i>Frenchman</i>, that the <i>Indians</i> were very proud to see
one of their brothers, the <i>English</i>, among them; at which
the <i>French</i> captain appeared low spirited, and seemed to
eat his dinner with very little appetite.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the <i>Indian</i> kings and captains called
me aside, and desired me to read them the writings that
I had. First I read part of the <i>Easton</i> treaty to them;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
but they presently stopped me, and would not hear it; I
then began with the articles of peace made with the
<i>Indians</i> there. They stopped me again, and said, they
had nothing to say to any treaty, or league, of peace,
made at <i>Easton</i>, nor had any thing to do with <i>Teedyuscung</i>;
that, if I had nothing to say to them from the government,
or Governor, they would have nothing to say to me; and
farther said, they had hitherto been at war with the <i>English</i>,
and had never expected to be at peace with them
again; and that there were six of their men now gone to
war against them with other <i>Indians</i>; that had there been
peace between us, those men should not have gone to
war. I then shewed them the belts and strings from the
Governor; and they again told me to lay aside <i>Teedyuscung</i>,
and the peace made by him; for that they had
nothing to do with it.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I desired them to suffer me to
produce my papers, and I would read what I had to say
to them.</p>

<p>18th.—<i>Delaware George</i> is very active in endeavouring
to establish a peace. I believe he is in earnest. Hitherto
they have all treated me kindly.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, all the kings and captains were called
together, and sent for me to their council. King Beaver
first addressed himself to the captains; and afterwards
spoke to me, as follows:</p>

<p>“Brother, you have been here now five days by our
fire.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> We have sent to all the kings and captains, desiring
them to come to our fire and hear the good news<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
you brought. Yesterday they sent two captains to
acquaint us, they were glad to hear our <i>English</i> brother
was come among us, and were desirous to hear the good
news he brought; and since there are a great many nations
that went [want] to see our brother, they have invited
us to their fire, that they may hear us all. Now, brother,
we have but one great fire; so, brother, by this string we
will take you in our arms, and deliver you into the arms
of the other kings, and when we have called all the nations
there, we will hear the good news, you have brought.”
Delivers four strings.</p>

<p>King <i>Beaver</i>, <i>Shingas</i>, and <i>Delaware George</i>, spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>“Brother, we alone cannot make a peace; it would be
of no significance; for, as all the <i>Indians</i>, from the sunrise
to the sunset, are united in a body, it is necessary
that the whole should join in the peace, or it can be no
peace; and we can assure you, all the <i>Indians</i>, a great
way from this, even beyond the lakes, are desirous of,
and wish for a peace with the <i>English</i>, and have desired us,
as we are the nearest of kin, if we see the <i>English</i> incline
a peace, to hold it fast.”</p>

<p>On the 19th, all the people gathered together, men,
women, and children; and king <i>Beaver</i> desired me to
read to them the news I had brought, and told me that
all the able men would go with me to the other town.
I complied with his desire, and they appeared very much
pleased at every thing, till I came to that part respecting
the prisoners. This they disliked; for, they say, it
appears very odd and unreasonable that we should
demand prisoners before there is an established peace;
such an unreasonable demand makes us appear as if we
wanted brains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>20th.—We set out from <i>Kushkushkee</i>, for <i>Sankonk</i>; my
company consisted of twenty-five horsemen and fifteen
foot. We arrived at <i>Sankonk</i>, in the afternoon. The
people of the town were much disturbed at my coming,
and received me in a very rough manner. They surrounded
me with drawn knives in their hands, in such a
manner, that I could hardly get along; running up against
me, with their breasts open, as if they wanted some pretence
to kill me. I saw by their countenances they
sought my death. Their faces were quite distorted with
rage, and they went so far as to say, I should not live long;
but some <i>Indians</i>, with whom I was formerly acquainted,
coming up, and saluting me in a friendly manner, their
behaviour to me was quickly changed.</p>

<p>On the 21st, they sent Messengers to Fort <i>Duquesne</i>, to
let them know I was there, and invited them to their fire.
In the afternoon, I read them all my message, the <i>French</i>
captain being present; for he still continued with us: upon
which they were more kind to me. In the evening, fifteen
more arrived here from <i>Kushkushkee</i>. The men here
now [were] about one hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>22d.—Arrived about twenty <i>Shawanese</i> and <i>Mingos</i>.
I read to them the message; at which they seemed well
pleased. Then the two kings came to me, and spoke in
the following manner:</p>

<p>“Brother, we, the <i>Shawanese</i> and <i>Mingos</i>, have heard
your message; the messenger we sent to Fort <i>Duquesne</i>,
is returned, and tells us, there are eight different nations
there, who want to hear your message; we will conduct
you there, and let both the <i>Indians</i> and <i>French</i> hear what
our brothers, the English, have to say.”</p>

<p>I protested against going to Fort <i>Duquesne</i>, but all in
vain; for they insisted on my going, and said that I need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
not fear the <i>French</i>, for they would carry me in their
bosoms, i. e. engage for my safety.</p>

<p>23d.—We set off for Fort <i>Duquesne</i>, and went no
farther this night than Log’s town, where I met with
four <i>Shawanese</i>, who lived in <i>Wyoming</i> when I did.
They received me very kindly, and called the prisoners to
shake hands with me, as their countryman, and gave me
leave to go into every house to see them, which was done
in no other town besides.</p>

<p>24th.—They called to me, and desired that I would
write to the general for them. The jealousy natural to
the <i>Indians</i> is not to be described; for though they wanted
me to write for them, they were afraid I would, at the
same time, give other information, and this perplexed
them.</p>

<p>We continued our journey to the fort; and arrived in
sight, on this side the river, in the afternoon, and all the
<i>Indian</i> chiefs immediately came over; they called me
into the middle, and king <i>Beaver</i> presented me to them,
and said, “Here is our <i>English</i> brother, who has brought
great news.” Two of them rose up and signified they
were glad to see me. But an old deaf <i>Onondago Indian</i>
rose up and signified his displeasure. This <i>Indian</i> is
much disliked by the others; he had heard nothing yet,
that had passed, he has lived here a great while, and constantly
lives in the fort, and is mightily attached to the
<i>French</i>; he spoke as follows, to the <i>Delawares</i>:</p>

<p>“I do not know this <i>Swannock</i>;<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> it may be that you
know him. I, the <i>Shawanese</i>, and our father<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> do not
know him. I stand here (stamping his foot) as a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
on his own ground;<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> therefore, I, the <i>Shawanese</i> and my
father do not like that a <i>Swannock</i> come on our ground.”
Then there was silence awhile, till the pipe went round;<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
after that was over, one of the <i>Delawares</i> rose up, and
spoke in opposition to him that spoke last, and delivered
himself as follows:</p>

<p>“That man speaks not as a man; he endeavours to
frighten us, by saying this ground is his; he dreams; he
and his father have certainly drunk too much liquor;
they are drunk; pray let them go to sleep till they are
sober. You do not know what your own nation does,
at home; how much they have to say to the <i>Swannocks</i>.
You are quite rotten. You stink.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> You do nothing
but smoke your pipe here. Go to sleep with your father,
and when you are sober we will speak to you.”</p>

<p>After this the <i>French</i> demanded me of the <i>Indians</i>.
They said it was a custom among the white people when a
messenger came, even if it was the Governor, to blind his
eyes, and lead him into the fort, to a prison, or private
room. They, with some of the <i>Indians</i> insisted very
much on my being sent into the fort, but to no purpose;
for the other <i>Indians</i> said to the <i>French</i>; “It may be a
rule among you, but we have brought him here, that all
the <i>Indians</i> might see him, and hear what our brothers
the English have to say; and we will not suffer him to be
blinded and carried into the fort.” The <i>French</i> still
insisted on my being delivered to them; but the <i>Indians</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
desired them, to let them hear no more about it; but to
send them one hundred loaves of bread; for they were
hungry.</p>

<p>25th.—This morning early they sent us over a large
bullock, and all the <i>Indian</i> chiefs came over again, and
counselled a great deal among themselves; then the
<i>Delaware</i>, that handled the old deaf <i>Onondago</i> Indian so
roughly yesterday, addressed himself to him, in this
manner; “I hope, to day, you are sober. I am certain
you did not know what you said yesterday. You endeavoured
to frighten us; but know, <i>we are now men</i>,
and not so easily frightened. You said something yesterday
of the <i>Shawanese</i>; see here what they have sent
you,” (<i>presenting him with a large roll of tobacco</i>.)</p>

<p>Then the old deaf <i>Indian</i> rose up, and acknowledged
he had been in the wrong; he said, that he had now
cleaned <i>himself</i>,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and hoped they would forgive him.</p>

<p>Then the Delaware delivered the message, that was
sent by the <i>Shawanese</i> which was, “That they hoped the
<i>Delawares</i>, &amp;c. would be strong,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> in what they were
undertaking; that they were extremely proud to hear
such good news from their brothers, the <i>English</i>; that
whatever contracts they made with the <i>English</i>, the
<i>Shawanese</i> would agree to; that they were their brothers,
and that they loved them.”</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> whispered to the <i>Indians</i>, as I imagined,
to insist on my delivering what I had to say, on the other
side of the water. Which they did to no purpose, for
my company still insisted on a hearing on this side the
water. The <i>Indians</i> crossed the river to council with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
their Fathers.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> My company desired to know whether
they would hear me or no. This afternoon three hundred
<i>Canadians</i> arrived at the fort, and reported that six
hundred more were soon to follow them, and forty battoes
laden with amunition. Some of my party desired me
not to stir from the fire; for that the <i>French</i> had offered
a great reward for my scalp, and that there were several
parties out on that purpose. Accordingly I stuck constantly
as close to the fire, as if I had been chained there.</p>

<p>26th.—The Indians, with a great many of the <i>French</i>
officers, came over to hear what I had to say. The
officers brought with them a table, pens, ink and paper.
I spoke in the middle of them with a free conscience, and
perceived by the look of the <i>French</i>, they were not pleased
with what I said; the particulars of which were as follows;
I spoke in the name of the government and people of
<i>Pensilvania</i>.</p>

<p>“Brethren at Allegheny, We have a long time desired
to see and hear from you; you know the road was quite
stopt; and we did not know how to come through. We
have sent many messengers to you; but we did not hear
of you; now we are very glad we have found an opening
to come and see you, and to speak with you, and to hear
your true mind and resolution. We salute you very
heartily.” A string, No. 1.</p>

<p>“Brethren at Allegheny, Take notice of what I say.
You know that the bad spirit has brought something
between us, that has kept us at a distance one from
another; I now, by this belt, take every thing out of the
way, that the bad spirit has brought between us, and all
the jealousy and fearfulness we had of one another, and
whatever else the bad spirit might have poisoned your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
heart and mind with, that nothing of it may be left.
Moreover let us look up to God, and beg for his assistance,
that he may put into our hearts what pleases him,
and join us close in that brotherly love and friendship,
which our grandfathers had. We assure you of our love
towards you.” A belt of eleven rows.</p>

<p>“Brothers at Allegheny, Hearken to what I say; we
began to hear of you from <i>Wellemeghihink</i>, who returned
from <i>Allegheny</i>. We heard you had but a slight,
confused account of us; and did not know of the peace,
we made twelve months past, in <i>Easton</i>. It was then
agreed, that the large belt of peace should be sent to you
at <i>Allegheny</i>. As these our two old friends from <i>Allegheny</i>,
who are well known to many here, found an opening
to come to our council fire, to see with their own eyes,
to sit with us face to face, to hear with their own ears,
every thing that has been transacted between us; it gives
me and all the people of the province great pleasure to
see them among us. And I assure all my brethren at
<i>Allegheny</i>, that nothing would please me, and all the
people of the province better, than to see our countrymen
the <i>Delawares</i> well settled among us.” A belt.</p>

<p>“Hearken, my brethren at <i>Allegheny</i>. When we
began to make peace with the <i>Delawares</i>, twelve months
ago, in behalf of ten other nations, we opened a road, and
cleared the bushes from the blood, and gathered all
the bones, on both sides, together; and when we had
brought them together, in one heap, we could find no
place to bury them: we would not bury them as our
grandfathers did. They buried them under ground,
where they may be found again. We prayed to God, that
he would have mercy on us, and take all these bones
away from us, and hide them, that they might never be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
found any more; and take from both sides all the remembrance
of them out of our heart and mind. And we
have a firm confidence, that God will be pleased to take
all the bones and hide them from us, that they may never
be remembered by us, while we live, nor our children,
nor grand children, hereafter. The hatchet was buried
on both sides, and large belts of peace exchanged. Since
we have cleared every thing from the heart, and taken
every thing out of our way; now, my brethren at <i>Allegheny</i>,
every one that hears me, if you will join with us,
in that brotherly love and friendship, which our grandfathers
had, we assure you, that all past offences shall
be forgotten, and never more talked of, by us, our children
and grand children hereafter. This belt assures
you of our sincerity, and honest and upright heart towards
you.” A belt of seven rows.</p>

<p>“Hearken, brethren at <i>Allegheny</i>. I have told you
that we really made peace with part of your nation,
twelve months past; I now by this belt open the road from
<i>Allegheny</i> to our council fire, where your grandfathers
kept good councils with us, that all may pass without
molestation or danger. You must be sensible, that
unless a road be kept open, people at variance can never
come together to make up their differences. Messengers
are free in all nations throughout the world, by a particular
token. Now, brethren at <i>Allegheny</i>, I desire
you will join with me in keeping the road open, and let us
know in what manner we may come free to you, and what
the token shall be. I join both my hands to yours, and
will do all in my power to keep the road open.” A
belt of seven rows.</p>

<p>“Now, brethren at <i>Allegheny</i>, Hear what I say.
Every one that lays hold of this belt of peace, I proclaim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
peace to them from the <i>English</i> nation, and let you
know that the great king of <i>England</i> does not incline to
have war with the <i>Indians</i>; but he wants to live in peace
and love with them, if they will lay down the hatchet, and
leave off war against him.”</p>

<p>“We love you farther, we let you know that the great
king of <i>England</i> has sent a great number of warriors into
this country, not to go to war against the <i>Indians</i>, in
their towns, no, not at all; these warriors are going against
the <i>French</i>; they are on the march to the <i>Ohio</i>, to revenge
the blood they have shed. And by this belt I take you
by the hand, and lead you at a distance from the <i>French</i>,
for your own safety, that your legs may not be stained
with blood. Come away on this side of the mountain,
where we may oftener converse together, and where
your own flesh and blood lives. We look upon you as
our countrymen, that sprung out of the same ground
with us; we think, therefore, that it is our duty to take
care of you, and we in brotherly love advise you to come
away with your whole nation, and as many of your
friends as you can get to follow you. We do not come
to hurt you, we love you, therefore we do not call you to
war, that you may be slain; what benefit will it be to you
to go to war with your own flesh and blood? We wish
you may live without fear or danger with your women
and children.” The large peace belt.</p>

<p>“Brethren, I have almost finished what I had to say,
and hope it will be to your satisfaction; my wish is, that
we may join close together in that old brotherly love and
friendship, which our grandfathers had; so that all
the nations may hear and see us, and have the benefit
of it; and if you have any uneasiness, or complaint, in
your heart and mind, do not keep it to yourself. We have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
opened the road to the council fire, therefore, my brethren,
come and acquaint the Governor with it; you will be
readily heard, and full justice will be done you.” A
belt.</p>

<p>“Brethren, One thing I must bring to your remembrance.
You know, if any body loses a little child, or
some body takes it from him, he cannot be easy, he will
think on his child by day and night; since our flesh and
blood is in captivity, in the <i>Indian</i> towns, we desire you
will rejoice the country’s heart, and bring them to me;
I shall stretch out my arms to receive you kindly.” A
string.</p>

<p>After I had done, I left my belts and strings still before
them. The <i>Delawares</i> took them all up, and laid them
before the <i>Mingoes</i>;<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> upon which they rose up, and
spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“<i>Chau</i>, What I have heard pleases me well; I do not
know why I go to war against the <i>English</i>. <i>Noques</i>,
what do you think? You must be strong. I did not
begin the war, therefore, I have little to say; but whatever
you agree to, I will do the same.” Then he addressed
himself to the <i>Shawanese</i>, and said, “You
brought the hatchet to us from the <i>French</i>, and persuaded
us to strike our brothers the <i>English</i>; you may
consider (laying the belts, &amp;c. before them) wherefore
you have done this.”</p>

<p>The <i>Shawanese</i> acknowledged they received the hatchet
from the <i>French</i>, who persuaded them to strike the <i>English</i>;
that they would now send the belts to all the <i>Indians</i>,
and in twelve days would meet again.</p>

<p>Present at this council, three hundred <i>French</i> and
<i>Indians</i>. They all took leave, and went over again to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the fort, but my companions, who were about seventy in
number.</p>

<p><i>Shamokin Daniel</i>, who came with me, went over to
the fort by himself, (which my companions disapproved
of) and counselled with the Governor; who presented him
with a laced coat and hat, a blanket, shirts, ribbons, a
new gun, powder, lead, &amp;c. When he returned he was
quite changed, and said, “See here, you fools, what the
<i>French</i> have given me. I was in <i>Philadelphia</i>, and never
received a farthing;” and, directing himself to me, he
said, “The English are fools, and so are you.” In
short, he behaved in a very proud, saucy and imperious
manner. He further said, “The <i>English</i> never give the
<i>Indians</i> any powder, and that the <i>French</i> would have
given him a horseload, if he would have taken it; see that
young man there, he was in <i>Philadelphia</i> and never got
any thing; I will take him over to the <i>French</i>; and get
some cloathing for him.”</p>

<p>Three <i>Indians</i> informed me, that as soon as the <i>French</i>
got over, they called a council, with their own <i>Indians</i>,
among whom there happened accidentally to be a <i>Delaware</i>
captain, who was privately invited by one of his
acquaintances to hear what the French had to say; and
when they were assembled, the <i>French</i> spoke, as
follows:</p>

<p>“My children, now we are alone, hearken to what I
have to say. I perceive the <i>Delawares</i> are wavering;
they incline to the <i>English</i>, and will be faithful to us no
longer. Now all the chiefs are here, and but a handful,
let us cut them off, and then we shall be troubled with
them no longer.” Then the <i>Tawaas</i> [Ottawas] answered,
“No, we cannot do this thing; for though there
is but a handful here, the <i>Delawares</i> are a strong people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
and are spread to a great distance, and whatever they
agree to must be.”</p>

<p>This afternoon, in council, on the other side of the
river, the <i>French</i> insisted that I must be delivered up to
them, and that it was not lawful for me to go away; which
occasioned a quarrel between them and the <i>Indians</i>,
who immediately came away and crossed the river to me;
and some of them let me know thet <i>Daniel</i> had received
a string from the <i>French</i>, to leave me there; but it was
to no purpose, for they would not give their consent; and
then agreed that I should set off before day the next
morning.</p>

<p>27th.—Accordingly, I set out before day, with six
<i>Indians</i>, and took another road, that we might not be
seen; the main body told me, they would stay behind,
to know whether the <i>French</i> would make an attempt to
take me by force; that if they did, they, the <i>Indians</i>, would
endeavour to prevent their crossing the river, and coming
secretly upon me. Just as I set off the <i>French</i> fired all
their great guns, it being Sunday (I counted nineteen) and
concluded they did the same every Sabbath. We passed
through three <i>Shawanese</i> towns; the <i>Indians</i> appeared
very proud to see me return, and we arrived about night
at <i>Sawcunk</i>, where they were likewise very glad to see
me return. Here I met with the two captains, who
treated me so uncivilly before; they now received me very
kindly, and accepted of my hand, and apologized for their
former rude behaviour. Their names are <i>Kuckquetackton</i>
and <i>Killbuck</i>.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> They said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“Brother, we, in behalf of the people of <i>Sawcunk</i>,
desire that you will hold fast what you have begun, and
be strong.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> We are but little and poor, and therefore
cannot do much. You are rich, and must go on and be
strong. We have done all in our power towards bringing
about a peace: we have had a great quarrel about you
with the <i>French</i>; but we do not mind them. Do you
make haste, and be strong, and let us see you again.”
The said <i>Killbuck</i> is a great captain and conjurer; he
desired me to mention him to the Governor, and ask him
if he would be pleased to send him a good saddle by the
next messenger; and that he would do all in his power
for the service of the English.</p>

<p>28th.—We set out from <i>Sawcunk</i>, in company with
twenty, for <i>Kushkushkee</i>; on the road <i>Shingas</i> addressed
himself to me, and asked, if I did not think, that, if he
came to the English, they would hang him, as they had
offered a great reward for his head. He spoke in a very
soft and easy manner. I told him that was a great while
ago, it was all forgotten and wiped clean away; that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
English would receive him very kindly. Then <i>Daniel</i>
interrupted me, and said to <i>Shingas</i>, “Do not believe
him, he tells nothing but idle lying stories. Wherefore
did the <i>English</i> hire one thousand two hundred <i>Indians</i><a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
to kill us.” I protested it was false; he said, G—d d—n<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
you for a fool; did you not see the woman lying [in] the road
that was killed by the <i>Indians</i>, that the <i>English</i> hired?
I said, “Brother do consider how many thousand <i>Indians</i>
the <i>French</i> have hired to kill the <i>English</i>, and how many
they have killed along the frontiers.” Then <i>Daniel</i>
said, “D—n you, why do not you and the <i>French</i> fight
on the sea? You come here only to cheat the poor
<i>Indians</i>, and take their land from them.” Then <i>Shingas</i>
told him to be still; for he did not know what he said.
We arrived at <i>Kushkushkee</i> before night, and I informed
<i>Pisquetumen</i> of <i>Daniel’s</i> behaviour, at which he appeared
sorry.</p>

<p>29th.—I dined with <i>Shingas</i>; he told me, though the
<i>English</i> had set a great price on his head, he had never
thought to revenge himself, but was always very kind to
any prisoners that were brought in;<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and that he assured
the Governor, he would do all in his power to bring
about an established peace, and wished he could be certain
of the <i>English</i> being in earnest.</p>

<p>Then seven chiefs present said, when the Governor
sends the next messenger, let him send two or three white
men, at least, to confirm the thing, and not send such
a man as <i>Daniel</i>; they did not understand him; he always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
speaks, said they, as if he was drunk; and if a great many
of them had not known me, they should not know what
to think; for every thing I said he contradicted. I
assured them I would faithfully inform the Governor of
what they said, and they should see, as messengers, other
guise <i>Indians</i> than <i>Daniel</i>, for the time to come; and I
farther informed them, that he was not sent by the Governor,
but came on his own accord; and I would endeavour
to prevent his coming back. <i>Daniel</i> demanded of me
his pay, and I gave him three dollars; and he took as
much wampum from me as he pleased, and would not
suffer me to count it. I imagined there was about two
thousand.</p>

<p>About night, nine <i>Tawaas</i> past by here, in their way
to the <i>French</i> fort.</p>

<p>30th and 31st.—The <i>Indians</i> feasted greatly, during
which time, I several times begged of them to consider and
dispatch me.</p>

<p>September 1st.—<i>Shingas</i>, King <i>Beaver</i>, <i>Delaware
George</i>, and <i>Pisquetumen</i>, with several other captains said
to me,</p>

<p>“Brother, We have thought a great deal since God
has brought you to us; and this is a matter of great consequence,
which we cannot readily answer; we think on
it, and will answer you as soon as we can. Our feast
hinders us; all our young men, women and children are
glad to see you; before you came, they all agreed together
to go and join the <i>French</i>; but since they have seen you,
they all draw back; though we have great reason to
believe you intend to drive us away, and settle the country;
or else, why do you come to fight in the land that God
has given us?”</p>

<p>I said, we did not intend to take the land from them;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
but only to drive the <i>French</i> away. They said, they
knew better; for that they were informed so by our
greatest traders; and some Justices of the Peace had told
them the same, and the <i>French</i>, said they, tell us much the
same thing,—“that the <i>English</i> intend to destroy us,
and take our lands;” but the land is ours, and not theirs;
therefore, we say, if you will be at peace with us, we will
send the <i>French</i> home. It is you that have begun the
war, and it is necessary that you hold fast, and be not
discouraged, in the work of peace. We love you more
than you love us; for when we take any prisoners from
you, we treat them as our own children. We are poor,
and yet we clothe them as well as we can, though you see
our children are as naked as at the first. By this you
may see that our hearts are better than yours. It is plain
that you white people are the cause of this war; why do
not you and the <i>French</i> fight in the old country, and on
the sea? Why do you come to fight on our land? This
makes every body believe, you want to take the land from
us by force, and settle it.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>I told them, “Brothers, as for my part, I have not one
foot of land, nor do I desire to have any; and if I had any
land, I had rather give it to you, than take any from you.
Yes, brothers, if I die, you will get a little more land from
me; for I shall then no longer walk on that ground,
which God has made. We told you that you should keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
nothing in your heart, but bring it before the council fire,
and before the Governor, and his council; they will
readily hear you; and I promise you, what they answer
they will stand to. I further read to you what agreements
they made about <i>Wioming</i>,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and they stand to them.”</p>

<p>They said, “Brother, your heart is good, you speak
always sincerely; but we know there are always a great
number of people that want to get rich; they never have
enough; look, we do not want to be rich, and take away
that which others have. God has given you the tame
creatures; we do not want to take them from you. God
has given to us the deer, and other wild creatures, which
we must feed on; and we rejoice in that which springs out
of the ground, and thank God for it. Look now, my
brother, the white people think we have no brains in our
heads; but that they are great and big, and that makes
them make war with us: we are but a little handful to
what you are; but remember, when you look for a wild
turkey you cannot always find it, it is so little it hides
itself under the bushes: and when you hunt for a rattle-snake,
you cannot find it; and perhaps it will bite you
before you see it. However, since you are so great and
big, and we so little, do you use your greatness and
strength in compleating this work of peace. This is the
first time that we saw or heard of you, since the war
begun, and we have great reason to think about it, since
such a great body of you comes into our lands.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> It is
told us, that you and the <i>French</i> contrived the war, to
waste the <i>Indians</i> between you; and that you and the
<i>French</i> intended to divide the land between you: this was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
told us by the chief of the <i>Indian</i> traders; and they said
further, brothers, this is the last time we shall come among
you; for the <i>French</i> and the <i>English</i> intend to kill all the
<i>Indians</i>, and then divide the land among themselves.”</p>

<p>Then they addressed themselves to me, and said,
“Brother, I suppose you know something about it; or
has the Governor stopped your mouth, that you cannot
tell us?”</p>

<p>Then I said, “Brothers, I am very sorry to see you so
jealous. I am your own flesh and blood, and sooner than
I would tell you any story that would be of hurt to you,
or your children, I would suffer death: and if I did not
know that it was the desire of the Governor, that we
should renew our old brotherly love and friendship, that
subsisted between our grandfathers, I would not have
undertaken this journey. I do assure you of mine and
the people’s honesty. If the <i>French</i> had not been here,
the <i>English</i> would not have come; and consider, brothers,
whether, in such a case, we can always sit still.”</p>

<p>Then they said, “It is a thousand pities we did not
know this sooner; if we had, it would have been peace
long before now.”</p>

<p>Then I said, “My brothers, I know you have been
wrongly persuaded by many wicked people; for you must
know, that there are a great many Papists in the country,
in <i>French</i> interest, who appear like gentlemen, and have
sent many runaway Irish papist servants<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> among you,
who have put bad notions into your heads, and strengthened
you against your brothers the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“Brothers, I beg that you would not believe every idle
and false story, that ill-designing people may bring to
you against us your brothers. Let us not hearken to
what lying and foolish people may bring to you, against
us your brothers. Let us not hearken to what lying and
foolish people say, but let us hear what wise and good
people say; they will tell us what is good for us and our
children.”</p>

<p>Mem. There are a great number of <i>Irish</i> traders now
among the <i>Indians</i>, who have always endeavoured to
spirit up the <i>Indians</i> against the <i>English</i>; which made
some, that I was acquainted with from their infancy,
desire the chiefs to enquire of me, for that they were certain
I would speak the truth.</p>

<p><i>Pisquetumen</i> now told me, we could not go to the
General, that it was very dangerous, the <i>French</i> having
sent out several scouts to wait for me on the road. And
further, <i>Pisquetumen</i> told me, it was a pity the Governor
had no ear,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to bring him intelligence; that the <i>French</i>
had three ears, whom they rewarded with great presents;
and signified, that he and <i>Shingas</i> would be ears, at the
service of his honour, if he pleased.</p>

<p>2d.—I bade <i>Shingas</i> to make haste and dispatch me,
and once more desired to know of them, if it was possible
for them to guide me to the General. Of all which they
told me they would consider; and <i>Shingas</i> gave me his
hand, and said, “Brother, the next time you come, I will
return with you to <i>Philadelphia</i>, and will do all in my
power to prevent any body’s coming to hurt the <i>English</i>
more.”</p>

<p>3d.—To-day I found myself unwell, and made a little
tea, which refreshed me: had many very pretty discourses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
with <i>George</i>. In the afternoon they called a council
together, and gave me the following answer in council;
the speaker addressing the Governor and people of
<i>Pennsylvania</i>:</p>

<p>“Brethren, It is a great many days since we have seen
or heard from you.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> I now speak to you in behalf of all
the nations, that have heard you heretofore.</p>

<p>“Brethren, it is the first message which we have seen
or heard from you. Brethren, you have talked of that
peace and friendship which we had formerly with you.
Brethren, we tell you to be strong, and always remember
that friendship, which we had formerly. Brethren, we
desire you would be strong, and let us once more hear
of our good friendship and peace, we had formerly.
Brethren, we desire that you make haste, and let us hear
of you again; for, as yet, we have not heard you rightly.”
Gives a string.</p>

<p>“Brethren, hear what I have to say: look, brethren,
we, who have now seen and heard you, we, who are
present, are part of all the several nations, that heard you
some days ago; we see that you are sorry we have not
that friendship, we formerly had.</p>

<p>“Look, brethren, we at <i>Allegheny</i> are likewise sorry
we have not that friendship with you, which we formerly
had. Brethren, we long for that peace and friendship
we had formerly. Brethren, it is good that you desire
that friendship, that was formerly among our fathers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
grandfathers. Brethren, we will tell you, you must not
let that friendship be quite lost, which was formerly
between us.</p>

<p>“Now, brethren, it is three years since we dropt that
peace and friendship, which we formerly had with you.
Brethren, it was dropt, and lay buried in the ground,
where you and I stand, in the middle between us both.
Brethren, I see you have digged up, and revived, that
friendship, which was buried in the ground; and now you
have it, hold it fast. Do be strong, brethren, and exert
yourselves, that that friendship may be well established
and finished between us. Brethren, if you will be strong,
it is in your power to finish that peace and friendship
well. Therefore, brethren, we desire you to be strong
and establish it, and make known to all the <i>English</i> this
peace and friendship, that it may embrace all and cover
all. As you are of one nation and colour, in all the
<i>English</i> governments, so let the peace be the same with
all. Brethren, when you have finished this peace, which
you have begun; when it is known every where amongst
your brethren, and you have every where agreed together
on this peace and friendship, then you will be pleased to
send the great peace belt to us at <i>Allegheny</i>.</p>

<p>“Brethren, when you have settled this peace and
friendship, and finished it well, and you send the great
peace-belt to me, I will send it to all the nations of my
colour, they will all join to it, and we all will hold it
fast.</p>

<p>“Brethren, when all the nations join to this friendship,
then the day will begin to shine clear over us. When
we hear once more of you, and we join together, then the
day will be still, and no wind, or storm, will come over
us, to disturb us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>“Now, brethren, you know our hearts, and what we
have to say; be strong; if you do what we have now told
you, and in this peace all the nations agree to join. Now,
brethren, let the king of <i>England</i> know what our mind is
as soon as possibly you can.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Gives a belt of eight rows.</p>

<p>I received the above speech and belt from the underwritten,
who are all captains and counsellors.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">Beaver, King</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Delaware George</span>,</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Delaware George</i> spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“Look, brothers, we are here of three different nations.
I am of the Unami nation:<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I have heard all the speeches
that you have made to us with the many other nations.</p>

<p>“Brothers, you did let us know, that every one that
takes hold of this peace-belt, you would take them by the
hand, and lead them to the council fire, where our grandfathers
kept good councils. So soon as I heard this, I
took hold of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“Brother, I now let you know that my heart never was
parted from you. I am sorry that I should make friendship
with the <i>French</i> against the <i>English</i>. I now assure
you my heart sticks close to the English interest. One
of our great captains, when he heard it, immediately
took hold of it as well as myself. Now, Brother, I let
you know that you shall soon see me by your council fire,
and then I shall hear from you myself, the plain truth, in
every respect.</p>

<p>“I love that which is good, like as our grandfathers
did: they chose to speak the sentiments of their mind: all
the <i>Five Nations</i> know me, and know that I always spoke
truth; and so you shall find, when I come to your council
fire.” Gives a string.</p>

<p>The above <i>Delaware George</i> had in company with him,</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">Cushawmekwy</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Kehkehnopatin</span>,</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Stinfeor</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4th.—Present, <i>Shingas</i>, King <i>Beaver</i>, <i>Pisquetumen</i>,
and several others. I asked what they meant by saying,
“<i>They had not rightly heard me yet.</i>” They said,</p>

<p>“Brother, you very well know that you have collected
all your young men about the country, which makes
a large body;<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and now they are standing <i>before our
doors</i>;<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> you come with good news and fine speeches.
Brother, this is what makes us jealous, and we do not
know what to think of it: if you had brought the news of
peace before your army had begun to march, it would
have caused a great deal more good. We do not so
readily believe you, because a great many great men and
traders have told us, long before the war, that you and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
the <i>French</i> intended to join and cut all the <i>Indians</i> off.
These were people of your own colour, and your own
countrymen; and some told us to join the <i>French</i>; for
that they would be our fathers: besides, many runaways
have told us the same story; and some we took prisoners
told us how you would use us, if you caught us: therefore,
brother, I say, we cannot conclude, at this time, but must
see and hear you once more.” And further they said,</p>

<p>“Now, brother, you are here with us, you are our flesh
and blood, speak from the bottom of your heart, will not
the <i>French</i> and <i>English</i> join together to cut off the
<i>Indians</i>? Speak, brother, from your heart, and tell us
the truth, and let us know who were the beginners of the
war.”</p>

<p>Then I delivered myself thus:</p>

<p>“Brothers, I love you from the bottom of my heart.
I am extremely sorry to see the jealousy so deeply rooted
in your hearts and minds. I have told you the truth;
and yet, if I was to tell it you a hundred times, it seems you
would not rightly believe me. My <i>Indian</i> brothers, I
wish you would draw your hearts to God, that he may
convince you of the truth.</p>

<p>“I do now declare, before God, that the <i>English</i> never
did, nor never will, join with the French to destroy you.
As far as I know, the <i>French</i> are the beginners of this
war. Brothers, about twelve years ago, you may remember,
they had war with the English, and they both agreed
to articles of peace. The <i>English</i> gave up <i>Cape Breton</i> in
<i>Acadia</i>, but the <i>French</i> never gave up the part of that
country, which they had agreed to give up; and, in a very
little time, made their <i>Children</i> strike the <i>English</i>. This
was the first cause of the war. Now, brothers; if any
body strike you three times, one after another, you still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
sit still and consider: they strike you again, then, my
brothers, you say, it is time, and you will rise up to defend
yourselves. Now, my brothers, this is exactly the case
between the <i>French</i> and <i>English</i>. Consider farther, my
brothers, what a great number of our poor back inhabitants
have been killed since the <i>French</i> came to the <i>Ohio</i>.
The French are the cause of their death, and if they were
not there, the <i>English</i> would not trouble themselves to go
there. They go no where to war, but where the French
are. Those wicked people that set you at variance with
the <i>English</i>, by telling you many wicked stories, are
papists in French pay: besides, there are many among us,
in the <i>French</i> service, who appear like gentlemen, and
buy Irish papist servants, and promise them great
rewards to run away to you and strengthen you against
the <i>English</i>, by making them appear as black as devils.”</p>

<p>This day arrived here two hundred <i>French</i> and <i>Indians</i>,
on their way to fort <i>Duquesne</i>. They staid all
night. In the middle of the night king <i>Beaver’s</i> daughter
died, on which a great many guns were fired in the town.</p>

<p>5th.—It made a general stop in my journey. The
<i>French</i> said to their Children, they should catch me
privately, or get my scalp. The commander wanted to
examine me, as he was going to <i>fort Duquesne</i>. When
they told me of it, I said, as he was going to <i>fort Duquesne</i>,
he might enquire about me there: I had nothing at all to
say, or do with the <i>French</i>: they would tell them every
particular they wanted to know in the fort. They all
came into the house where I was, as if they would see a
new creature.</p>

<p>In the afternoon there came six <i>Indians</i>, and brought
three German prisoners, and two scalps of the <i>Catabaws</i>.</p>

<p>As <i>Daniel</i> blamed the <i>English</i>, that they never paid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
him for his trouble, I asked him whether he was pleased
with what I paid him. He said, no. I said, “Brother,
you took as much as you pleased.” I asked you, whether
you was satisfied; you said, yes. I told him, I was
ashamed to hear him blame the country so. I told him,
“You shall have for this journey whatever you desire,
when I reach the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>6th.—<i>Pisquetumen</i>, <i>Tom Hickman</i> and <i>Shingas</i> told
me,</p>

<p>“Brother, it is good that you have stayed so long with
us; we love to see you, and wish to see you here longer;
but since you are so desirous to go, you may set off to
morrow: <i>Pisquetumen</i> has brought you here, and he may
carry you home again: you have seen us, and we have
talked a great deal together, which we have not done for a
long time before. Now, Brother, we love you, but cannot
help wondering why the <i>English</i> and <i>French</i> do not
make up with one another, and tell one another not to
fight on our land.”</p>

<p>I told them, “Brother, if the <i>English</i> told the <i>French</i> so
a thousand times, they never would go away. Brother,
you know so long as the world has stood there has not
been such a war. You know when the French lived
on the other side, the war was there, and here we lived
in peace. Consider how many thousand men are killed,
and how many houses are burned since the <i>French</i> lived
here; if they had not been here it would not have been so;
you know we do not blame you; we blame the <i>French</i>;
they are the cause of this war; therefore, we do not come
to hurt you, but to chastise the <i>French</i>.”</p>

<p>They told me, that at the great council, held at <i>Onondago</i>,
among the <i>Five Nations</i>, before the war began
(<i>Conrad Weiser</i> was there, and wrote every thing down)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
it was said to the <i>Indians</i> at the <i>Ohio</i>, that they should
let the <i>French</i> alone there, and leave it entirely to the
<i>Five Nations</i>; the <i>Five Nations</i> would know what to
do with them. Yet soon after two hundred <i>French</i> and
<i>Indians</i> came and built <i>Fort Duquesne</i>.</p>

<p>King <i>Beaver</i> and <i>Shingas</i> spoke to <i>Pisquetumen</i>.</p>

<p>“Brother, you told us that the Governor of <i>Philadelphia</i>
and <i>Teedyuscung</i> took this man out of their bosoms,
and put him into your bosom, that you should bring him
here; and you have brought him here to us; and we have
seen and heard him; and now we give him into your
bosom, to bring him to the same place again, before the
Governor; but do not let him quite loose; we shall rejoice
when we shall see him here again.” They desired me to
speak to the Governor, in their behalf, as follows:</p>

<p>“Brother, we beg you to remember our oldest brother,
<i>Pisquetumen</i>, and furnish him with good cloathes, and
reward him well for his trouble; for we shall look upon
him when he comes back.”</p>

<p>7th.—When we were ready to go, they began to council
which course we should go, to be safest; and then they
hunted for the horses, but could not find them; and so
we lost that day’s journey.</p>

<p>It is a troublesome cross and heavy yoke to draw this
people: They can punish and squeeze a body’s heart
to the utmost. I suspect the reason they kept me here so
long was by instigation of the <i>French</i>. I remember
somebody told me, the <i>French</i> told them to keep me
twelve days longer, for that they were afraid I should get
back too soon, and give information to the general. My
heart has been very heavy here, because they kept me
for no purpose. The Lord knows how they have been
counselling about my life; but they did not know who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
was my protector and deliverer: I believe my Lord has
been too strong against them; my enemies have done
what lies in their power.</p>

<p>8th.—We prepared for our journey on the morning,
and made ourselves ready. There came some together
and examined me what I had wrote yesterday. I told
them, I wondered what need they had to concern themselves
about my writing. They said, if they knew I had
wrote about the prisoners, they would not let me go out
of the town. I told them what I writ was my duty to do.
“Brothers, I tell you, I am not afraid of you, if there were
a thousand more. I have a good conscience before God
and man. I tell you I have wrote nothing about the
prisoners. I tell you, Brothers, this is not good; there’s
a bad spirit in your heart, which breeds that jealousy; and
it will keep you ever in fear, that you will never get rest.
I beg you would pray to God, for grace to resist that
wicked spirit, that breeds such wicked jealousies in
you; which is the reason you have kept me here so long.
How often have I begged of you to dispatch me? I am
ashamed to see you so jealous; I am not, in the least, afraid
of you. Have I not brought writings to you? and what,
do you think I must not carry some home, to the Governor?
or, shall I shut my mouth, and say nothing?
Look into your hearts, and see if it would be right or
wrong, if any body gives a salutation to their friends,
and it is not returned in the same way. You told me
many times how kind you were to the prisoners, and now
you are afraid that any of them should speak to me.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>They told me, they had cause to be afraid; and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
made a draught, and shewed me how they were surrounded
with war. Then I told them, if they would be
quiet, and keep at a distance, they need not fear. Then
they went away, very much ashamed, one after another.
I told my men, that we must make haste and go; accordingly
we set off, in the afternoon, from <i>Kushkushkee</i>, and
came ten miles.</p>

<p>9th.—We took a little foot-path hardly to be seen.
We left it, and went through thick bushes, till we came
to a mire, which we did not see, till we were in it; and
<i>Tom Hickman</i> fell in, and almost broke his leg. We had
hard work before we could get the horse out again. The
Lord helped me, that I got safe from my horse. I and
<i>Pisquetumen</i> had enough to do to come through. We
passed many such places: it rained all day; and we got
a double portion of it, because we received all that hung
on the bushes. We were as wet as if we were swimming
all the day; and at night we laid ourselves down in a
swampy place to sleep, where we had nothing but the
heavens for our covering.</p>

<p>10th.—We had but little to live on. <i>Tom Hickman</i>
shot a deer on the road. Every thing here, upon the
<i>Ohio</i>, is extremely dear, much more so than in <i>Pennsylvania</i>:
I gave for one dish of corn four hundred and sixty
<i>wampum</i>. They told me that the Governor of <i>fort
Duquesne</i> kept a store of his own, and that all the <i>Indians</i>
must come and buy the goods of him; and when they come
and buy, he tells them, if they will go to war, they shall
have as much goods as they please. Before I set off, I
heard further, that a <i>French</i> captain who goes to all the
<i>Indian</i> towns<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> came to <i>Sacunck</i>, and said, “Children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
will you not come and help your father against the <i>English</i>?”
They answered, “Why should we go to war
against our brethren? They are now our friends.” “O!
Children,” said he, “I hope you do not own them for
friends.” “Yes,” said they, “We do; we are their
friends, and we hope they will remain ours.” “O!
Children, said he, you must not believe what you have
heard, and what has been told you by that man.” They
said to him, “Yes, we do believe him more than we do you:
it was you that set us against them; and we will by and by
have peace with them;” and then he spoke not a word
more, but returned to the fort. So, I hope, some good is
done: praised be the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>11th.—Being Monday, we went over <i>Antigoc</i>:<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> we
went down a very steep hill, and our horses slipt so far,
that I expected, every moment, they would fall heels over
head. We found fresh <i>Indian</i> tracts on the other side
of the river. We crossed <i>Allegheny</i> river, and went
through the bushes upon a high hill, and slept upon the
side of the mountain, without fire, for fear of the enemy.
It was a cold night, and I had but a thin blanket to cover
myself.</p>

<p>12th.—We made a little fire, to warm ourselves in the
morning. Our horses began to be weary with climbing
up and down these steep mountains. We came this night
to the top of a mountain, where we found a log-house.
Here we made a small fire, just to boil ourselves a little
victuals. The <i>Indians</i> were very much afraid, and lay
with their guns and tomhocks on all night. They heard
somebody run and whisper in the night. I slept very
sound, and in the morning they asked me, if I was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
afraid the enemy <i>Indians</i> would kill me. I said, “No,
I am not afraid of the <i>Indians</i>, nor the devil himself: I
fear my great Creator, God.” “Aye, they said, you
know you will go to a good place when you die, but we do
not know that: that makes us afraid.”</p>

<p>13th.—In the afternoon we twice crossed <i>Chowatin</i>,
and came to <i>Ponchestanning</i>,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> an old deserted Indian
town, that lies on the same creek. We went through a
bad swamp, where were very thick sharp thorns, so that
they tore our cloaths and flesh, both hands and face, to a
bad degree. We had this kind of road all the day. In
the evening we made a fire, and then they heard something
rush, in the bushes, as though they heard somebody
walk. Then we went about three gun-shot from our
fire, and could not find a place to lie down on, for the
innumerable rocks; so that we were obliged to get small
stones to fill up the hollow places in the rocks, for our
bed; but it was very uneasy; almost shirt and skin grew
together. They kept watch one after another all night.</p>

<p>14th.—In the morning, I asked them what made them
afraid. They said, I knew nothing; the <i>French</i> had set
a great price on my head; and they knew there was gone
out a great scout to lie in wait for me. We went over
great mountains and a very bad road.</p>

<p>15th.—We came to <i>Susquehanna</i>, and crossed it six
times, and came to <i>Catawaweshink</i>, where had been an
old <i>Indian</i> town.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In the evening there came three
<i>Indians</i>, and said they saw two <i>Indian</i> tracks, which came
to the place where we slept, and turned back, as if to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
give information of us to a party; so that we were sure
they followed us.</p>

<p>16th and 17th.—We crossed the mountain.</p>

<p>18th.—Came to the <i>Big Island</i>, where having nothing
to live on, we were obliged to stay to hunt.</p>

<p>19th.—We met 20 warriors, who were returning from
the inhabitants, with five prisoners and one scalp; six
of them were <i>Delawares</i>, the rest <i>Mingoes</i>. We sat down
all in one ring together. I informed them where I had
been, and what was done; they asked me to go back a
little, and so I did, and slept all night with them. I informed
them of the particulars of the peace proposed;
they said, “If they had known so much before, they
would not have gone to war. Be strong; if you make a
good peace, then we will bring all the prisoners back
again.” They killed two deer, and gave me one.</p>

<p>20th.—We took leave of each other, and went on our
journey, and arrived the 22d at <i>fort Augusta</i>, in the afternoon,
very weary and hungry; but greatly rejoiced of our
return from this tedious journey.</p>

<p>There is not a prouder, or more high minded people, in
themselves, than the Indians. They think themselves
the wisest and prudentest men in the world; and that
they can over-power both the <i>French</i> and <i>English</i> when
they please. The white people are, in their eyes, nothing
at all. They say, that through their conjuring craft they
can do what they please, and nothing can withstand them.
In their way of fighting they have this method, to see
that they first shoot the officers and commanders; and
then, they say, we shall be sure to have them. They
also say, that if their conjurers run through the middle
of our people, no bullet can hurt them. They say too,
that when they have shot the commanders, the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
will all be confused, and will not know what to do. They
say of themselves, that every one of them is like a king
and captain, and fights for himself. By this way they
imagine they can overthrow any body of men, that may
come against them. They say, “The <i>English</i> people
are fools; they hold their guns half man high, and then
let them snap: we take sight and have them at a shot, and
so do the <i>French</i>; they do not only shoot with a bullet,
but big swan shot.” They say, the French load with a
bullet and six swan-shot. They further say, “We take
care to have the first shot at our enemies, and then they
are half dead before they begin to fight.”</p>

<p>The <i>Indians</i> are a people full of jealousy, and will not
easily trust any body; and they are very easily affronted,
and brought into jealousy; then afterwards they will have
nothing at all to do with those they suspect; and it is
not brought so easy out of their minds; they keep it to
their graves, and leave the seed of it in their children and
grand children’s minds; so, if they can, they will revenge
themselves for every imagined injury. They are a very
distrustful people. Through their imagination and reason
they think themselves a thousand times stronger than
all other people. <i>Fort du Quesne</i> is said to be under-mined.
The <i>French</i> have given out, that, if we over-power
them, and they should die, we should certainly all
die with them. When I came to the fort, the garrison, it
was said, consisted of about one thousand four hundred
men; and I am told they will now be full three thousand
<i>French</i> and <i>Indians</i>. They are almost all <i>Canadians</i>,
and will certainly meet the general before he comes to
the fort, in an ambush. You may depend upon it the
<i>French</i> will make no open field-battle, as in the old
country, but lie in ambush. The <i>Canadians</i> are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
hunters. The <i>Indians</i> have agreed to draw back; but
how far we may give credit to their promises the Lord
knows. It is the best way to be on our guard against
them, as they really could with one thousand over-power
eight thousand.</p>

<p>Thirty-two nights I lay in the woods; the heavens were
my covering. The dew came so hard sometimes, that
it pinched close to the skin. There was nothing that
laid so heavy on my heart, as the man that went along
with me. He thwarted me in every thing I said or did;
not that he did it against me, but against the country, on
whose business I was sent: I was afraid he would overthrow
what I went about. When he was with the <i>English</i>
he would speak against the <i>French</i>, and when with
the <i>French</i> against the <i>English</i>. The <i>Indians</i> observed
that he was a false fellow, and desired me, that I would
not bring him any more, to transact any business between
the <i>English</i> and them; and told me, it was through his
means I could not have the liberty to talk with the prisoners.</p>

<p>Praise and glory be to the <i>Lamb</i>, that has been slain,
and brought me through the country of dreadful jealousy
and mistrust, where the prince of this world has his rule
and government over the children of disobedience.</p>

<p>The Lord has preserved me through all the dangers and
difficulties, that I have ever been under. He directed
me according to his will, by his holy spirit. I had no one
to converse with but him. He brought me under a
thick, heavy, and dark cloud, into the open air; for which
I adore, praise, and worship the Lord my God, that I
know has grasped me in his hands, and has forgiven me
for all sins, and sent and washed my heart with his most
precious blood; that I now live not for myself, but for him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
that made me; and to do his holy will is my pleasure. I
own that, in the children of light, there dwells another
kind of spirit, than there does in the children of this
world; therefore, these two spirits cannot rightly agree in
fellowship.</p>

OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO THE INDIANS ON THE OHIO, IN THE LATTER PART OF THE
SAME YEAR.</h3>

</div>

<p><i>October 25th, 1758.</i>—Having received the orders of
the honourable Governor <i>Denny</i>,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> I set out from <i>Easton</i>
to <i>Bethlehem</i>, and arrived there about three o’clock in the
afternoon; I was employed most of the night, in preparing
myself with necessaries, &amp;c. for the journey.</p>

<p>26th.—Rose early, but my horse being lame, though I
travelled all the day, I could not, till after night, reach to
an inn, about ten miles from <i>Reading</i>.</p>

<p>27th.—I set out early, and about seven o’clock in the
morning came to <i>Reading</i>, and there found Captain <i>Bull</i>,
Mr. <i>Hays</i>,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and the <i>Indians</i> just mounted, and ready
to set out on their journey; they were heartily glad to see
me; <i>Pisquetomen</i> stretched out his arms, and said, “Now,
Brother, I am glad I have got you in my arms, I will not
let you go, I will not let you go again from me, you must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
go with me:” and I likewise said the same to him, and
told him, “I will accompany you, if you will go the same
way as I must go.” And then I called them together, in
Mr. <i>Weiser’s</i> house, and read a letter to them, which I
had received from the Governor, which is as follows, viz.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“To <i>Pisquetomen</i> and <i>Thomas Hickman</i>, to <i>Totiniontenna</i>
and <i>Shickalamy</i>, and to <i>Isaac Still</i>.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>“Brethren, Mr. <i>Frederick Post</i> is come express from
the general, who sends his compliments to you, and
desires you would come by the way of his camp, and give
him an opportunity of talking with you.</p>

<p>“By this string of wampum I request of you to alter
your intended rout by way of <i>Shamokin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and to go to
the general,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> who will give you a kind reception. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
nigher way, in which you will be better supplied with
provisions, and can travel with less fatigue and more
safety.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">William Denny.</span></p>

<p>“<i>Easton, October 23d, 1758.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>To which I added, “Brethren, I take you by this
string,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> by the hand, and lift you from this place, and lead
you along to the general.”</p>

<p>After which they consulted among themselves, and soon
resolved to go with me. We shook hands with each other,
and Mr. Hays immediately set out with them; after which,
having with some difficulty procured a fresh horse, in
the king’s service, I set off about noon with captain
<i>Bull</i>; and when we came to <i>Conrad Weiser’s</i> plantation,
we found <i>Pisquetomen</i> lying on the ground very drunk,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
which obliged us to stay there all night; the other <i>Indians</i>
were gone eight miles farther on their journey.</p>

<p>28th.—We rose early, and I spoke to <i>Pisquetomen</i> a
great deal; he was very sick, and could hardly stir; when
we overtook the rest, we found them in the same condition;
and they seemed discouraged, from going the way
to the general; and wanted to go through the woods. I
told them, I was sorry to see them wavering, and reminded
them, that when I went to their towns, I was not sent
to the <i>French</i>, but when your old men insisted on my
going to them, I followed their advice, and went; and as
the general is, in the king’s name, over the provinces, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
matters of war and peace, and the <i>Indians</i>, at <i>Allegheny</i>,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
want to know, whether all the <i>English</i> governments will
join in the peace with them; the way to obtain full satisfaction
is to go to him, and there you will receive another
great belt to carry home; which I desire you seriously to
take into consideration. They then resolved to go to
<i>Harris’s</i> ferry, and consider about it as they went;—we
arrived there late in the night.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>29th.—In the morning, the two <i>Cayugas</i> being most
desirous of going through the woods, the others continued
irresolute;<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> upon which I told them, “I wish you would
go with good courage, and with hearty resolution,” and
repeated what I had said to them yesterday, and reminded
them, as they were messengers, they should consider what
would be the best for their whole nation; “consult among
yourselves, and let me know your true mind and determination;”
and I informed them, I could not go with
them, unless they would go to the general, as I had messages
to deliver him. After which, having consulted
together, <i>Pesquitomen</i> came and gave me his hand, and
said, “Brother, here is my hand, we have all joined to
go with you, and we put ourselves under your protection
to bring us safe through, and to secure us from all danger.”
We came that night to <i>Carlisle</i><a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and found a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
small house without the fort, for the <i>Indians</i> to be by
themselves, and hired a woman to dress their victuals,
which pleased them well.</p>

<p>30th.—Setting out early, we came to <i>Shippensburg</i>,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and were lodged in the fort, where the <i>Indians</i> had a
house to themselves.</p>

<p>31st.—Set out early; in our passing by <i>Chambers</i>
Fort,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> some of the <i>Irish</i> people, knowing some of the
<i>Indians</i>, in a rash manner exclaimed against them, and
we had some difficulty to get them off clear. At fort
<i>Loudon</i> we met about sixteen of the <i>Cherokees</i>, who came
in a friendly manner to our <i>Indians</i>, enquiring for <i>Bill
Sockum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and shewed the pipe<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
    they had received from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
the <i>Shawanese</i>, and gave it, according to their custom,
to smoak out of, and said, they hoped they were friends
of the <i>English</i>. They knew me. <i>Pesquitomen</i> begged
me to give him some <i>wampum</i>, that he might speak to
them: I gave him 400 white <i>wampum</i>, and he then said
to them:—“We formerly had friendship one with another;
we are only messengers, and cannot say much, but by
these strings we let you know we are friends, and we are
about settling a peace with the <i>English</i>, and wish to be
at peace also with you, and all other <i>Indians</i>.”—And
informed them further, they came from a treaty, which
was held at <i>Easton</i>, between the <i>Eight United Nations</i>
and their confederates, and the <i>English</i>; in which peace
was established; and shewed them the two messengers
from the <i>Five Nations</i>, who were going, with them, to
make it known to all the <i>Indians</i> to the westward. Then
the <i>Cherokees</i> answered and said; “they should be glad
to know how far the friendship was to reach; they, for
themselves, wished it might reach from the sun-rise to
the sun-set; for, as they were in friendship with the <i>English</i>,
they would be at peace with all their friends, and at
war with their enemies.”</p>

<p>Nov. 1.—We reached fort <i>Littleton</i>,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in company with
the <i>Cherokees</i>, and were lodged, in the fort; they, and our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
<i>Indians</i>, in distinct places; and they entertained each other
with stories of their warlike adventures.</p>

<p>2d.—<i>Pesquitomen</i> said to me, “you have led us this
way, through the fire; if any mischief should befal us,
we shall lay it entirely to you; for we think it was your
doing, to bring us this way; you should have told us at
<i>Easton</i>, if it was necessary we should go to the general.”</p>

<p>I told him, “that I had informed the great men, at
<i>Easton</i>, that I then thought it would be best not to let
them go from thence, till they had seen the general’s
letter; and assured them that it was agreeable to the
general’s pleasure.”</p>

<p>3d.—<i>Pesquitomen</i> began to argue with captain <i>Bull</i>
and Mr. <i>Hays</i>, upon the same subject, as they did with
me, when I went to them with my first message; which
was, “that they should tell them, whether the general
would claim the land as his own, when he should drive
the <i>French</i> away? or, whether the <i>English</i> thought to
settle the country? We are always jealous the <i>English</i>
will take the land from us. Look, brother, what makes
you come with such a large body of men, and make such
large roads into our country; we could drive away the
<i>French</i> ourselves, without your coming into our country.”</p>

<p>Then I desired captain <i>Bull</i> and Mr. <i>Hays</i> to be careful
how they argued with the <i>Indians</i>; and be sure to
say nothing, that might affront them; for it may prove
to our disadvantage, when we come amongst them.
This day we came to <i>Rays-town</i>,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and with much difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
got a place to lodge the <i>Indians</i> by themselves, to
their satisfaction.</p>

<p>4th.—We intended to set out, but our <i>Indians</i> told
us, the <i>Cherokees</i> had desired them to stay that day, as
they intended to hold a council; and they desired us to
read over to them the governor’s message; which we
accordingly did. <i>Pesquitomen</i>, finding <i>Jenny Frazer</i>
there, who had been their prisoner, and escaped, spoke
to her a little rashly. Our <i>Indians</i>, waiting all the day,
and the <i>Cherokees</i> not sending to them, were displeased.</p>

<p>5th.—Rose early, and, it raining smartly, we asked our
<i>Indians</i>, if they would go; which they took time to consult
about.</p>

<p>The <i>Cherokees</i> came and told them, the <i>English</i> had
killed about thirty of their people, for taking some horses,
which they resented much; and told our <i>Indians</i> they had
better go home, than go any farther with us, lest they
should meet with the same. On hearing this, I told
them how I had heard it happened; upon which our
<i>Indians</i> said, they had behaved like fools, and brought
the mischief on themselves.</p>

<p><i>Pesquitomen</i>, before we went from hence, made it up
with <i>Jenny Frazer</i>, and they parted good friends; and
though it rained hard, we set out at 10 o’clock, and got
to the foot of the <i>Alleghenny</i>, and lodged at the first run
of water.</p>

<p>6th.—One of our horses went back; we hunted a good
while for him. Then we set off, and found one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
worst roads that ever was travelled until <i>Stoney creek</i>.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Upon the road we overtook a great number of pack
horses; whereon <i>Pesquitomen</i> said, “Brother, now you
see, if you had not come to us before, this road would not
be so safe as it is; now you see, we could have destroyed
all this people on the road, and great mischief would
have been done, if you had not stopt, and drawn our
people back.”—We were informed that the general was
not yet gone to fort <i>Duquesne</i>, wherefore <i>Pesquitomen</i>
said, he was glad, and expressed, “If I can come to our
towns before the general begins the attack, I know our
people will draw back, and leave the <i>French</i>.”—We
lodged this night at <i>Stoney creek</i>.</p>

<p>7th.—We arose early, and made all the haste we could
on our journey; we crossed the large creek, <i>Rekempalin</i>;
near <i>Lawrel hill</i>. Upon this hill we overtook the artillery,
and came, before sun set, to <i>Loyal Hanning</i>.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> We were
gladly received in the camp by the general, and most
of the people. We made our fire near the other <i>Indian</i>
camps; which pleased our people. Soon after some of
the officers came, and spoke very rashly to our <i>Indians</i>,
in respect to their conduct to our people; at which they
were much displeased, and answered as rashly, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
said, “they did not understand such usage; for they were
come upon a message of peace; if we had a mind to war,
they knew how to help themselves; and they were not
afraid of us.”</p>

<p>8th.—At eleven o’clock the general called the <i>Indians</i>
together, the <i>Cherokees</i> and <i>Catawbas</i> being present; he
spake to them in a kind and loving manner, and bid them
heartily welcome to his camp, and expressed his joy to see
them, and desired them to give his compliments to all their
kings and captains:—He desired them that had any love
for the <i>English</i> nation, to withdraw from the <i>French</i>;
for if he should find them among the <i>French</i>, he must
treat them as enemies, as he should advance with a large
army very soon, and cannot wait longer on account of
the winter season. After that he drank the king’s health,
and all that wish well to the <i>English</i> nation; then he
drank king <i>Beaver’s</i>, <i>Shingas</i>; and all the warrior’s
healths, and recommended us (the messengers) to their
care; and desired them to give credit to what we should
say. After that we went to another house with the general
alone; and he shewed them the belt, and said, he would
furnish them with a writing, for both the belt and string;
and after a little discourse more, our <i>Indians</i> parted in
love, and well satisfied. And we made all necessary preparations
for our journey.</p>

<p>9th.—Some of the colonels and chief commanders
wondered how I came through so many difficulties, and
how I could rule and bring these people to reason, making
no use of gun or sword. I told them, it is done by no
other means than by faith. Then they asked me, if I had
faith to venture myself to come safe through with my
companions. I told them, it was in my heart to pray for
them, “you know that the Lord has given many promises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
to his servants, and what he promises, you may depend
upon, he will perform.”—Then they wished us good
success. We waited till almost noon for the writing of
the general. We were escorted by an hundred men,
rank and file, commanded by captain <i>Haselet</i>;<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> we passed
through a tract of good land, about six miles on the old
trading path, and came to the creek again, where there
is a large fine bottom, well timbered; from thence we
came upon a hill, to an advanced breast work, about
ten miles from the camp, well situated for strength,
facing a small branch of the aforesaid creek; the hill
is steep down, perpendicular about twenty feet, on the
south side; which is a great defence; and on the west
side the breast-work about seven feet high, where we
encamped that night:<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> our <i>Indian</i> companions heard
that we were to part in the morning, and that twelve men
were to be sent with us, and the others, part of the company,
to go towards fort <i>Duquesne</i>. Our <i>Indians</i> desired
that the captain would send twenty men, instead of
twelve; that if any accident should happen, they could be
more able to defend themselves in returning back; “for
we know, say they, the enemy will follow the smallest
party.” It began to rain. Within five miles from the
breast-work we departed from captain <i>Haselet</i>; he kept
the old trading path to the <i>Ohio</i>. Lieutenant <i>Hays</i><a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[86]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
was ordered to accompany us to the <i>Alleghenny</i> river<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
with fourteen men. We went the path that leads along
the <i>Loyal Hanning</i> creek, where there is a rich fine bottom,
land well timbered, good springs and small creeks.
At four o’clock we were alarmed by three men, in <i>Indian</i>
dress; and preparation was made on both sides for defence.
<i>Isaac Still</i> shewed a white token, and <i>Pesquitomen</i>
gave an <i>Indian halloo</i>; after which they threw down their
bundles, and ran away as fast as they could. We afterwards
took up their bundles, and found that it was a
small party of our men, that had been long out. We
were sorry that we had scared them; for they lost their
bundles with all their food. Then, I held a conference
with our <i>Indians</i>, and asked them, if it would not be
good, to send one of our <i>Indians</i> to <i>Logstown</i> and <i>fort
Duquesne</i>, and call the <i>Indians</i> from thence, before we
arrive at <i>Kushkushking</i>. They all agreed it would not
be good, as they were but messengers; it must be done by
their chief men. The wolves made a terrible music this
night.</p>

<p>11th.—We started early, and came to the old <i>Shawanese</i>
town, called <i>Keckkeknepolin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> grown up thick with
weeds, briars and bushes, that we scarcely could get
through. <i>Pesquitomen</i> led us upon a steep hill, that our
horses could hardly get up; and <i>Thomas Hickman’s</i>
horse stumbled, and rolled down the hill like a wheel; on
which he grew angry, and would go no further with us,
and said, he would go by himself: It happened we found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
a path on the top of the hill. At three o’clock we came
to <i>Kiskemeneco</i>, an old <i>Indian</i> town, a rich bottom, well
timbered, good fine <i>English</i> grass, well watered, and
lays waste since the war began.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> We let our horses
feed here, and agreed that lieutenant <i>Hays</i> might go back
with his party; and as they were short of provisions, we,
therefore, gave them a little of ours, which they took very
kind of us. <i>Thomas Hickman</i> could find no other road,
and came to us again a little ashamed; we were glad to
see him; and we went about three miles farther, where we
made a large fire. Here the <i>Indians</i> looked over their
presents, and grumbled at me; they thought, if they had
gone the other way by <i>Shamokin</i>, they would have got
more. Captain Bull spoke in their favour against me.
Then I said to them, “I am ashamed to see you grumble
about presents; I thought you were sent to establish a
peace.” Though I confess I was not pleased that the
<i>Indians</i> were so slightly fitted out from <i>Easton</i>, as the
general had nothing to give them, in the critical circumstances
he was in, fit for their purpose.</p>

<p>12th.—Early in the morning, I spoke to the <i>Indians</i> of
my company, “Brethren, you have now passed through
the heart of the country back and forward, likewise
through the midst of the army, without any difficulty
or danger; you have seen and heard a great deal. When
I was among you, at <i>Alleghenny</i>, you told me, I should
not regard what the common people would say, but only
hearken to the chiefs; I should take no bad stories along.
I did accordingly; and when I left <i>Alleghenny</i> I dropt all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
evil reports, and only carried the agreeable news, which
was pleasing to all that heard it. Now, brethren, I beg
of you to do the same, and to drop all evil reports, which
you may have heard of bad people, and only to observe
and keep what you have heard of our rulers, and the
wise people, so that all your young men, women and
children, may rejoice at our coming to them, and may
have the benefit of it.”</p>

<p>They took it very kindly. After awhile they spoke in
the following manner to us, and said, “Brethren, when
you come to <i>Kushkushking</i>, you must not mind the
prisoners, and have nothing to do with them. Mr. <i>Post</i>,
when he was first there, listened too much to the prisoners;
the <i>Indians</i> were almost mad with him for it, and would
have confined him for it; for, they said, he had wrote
something of them.”</p>

<p>As we were hunting for our horses, we found <i>Thomas
Hickman’s</i> horse dead, which rolled yesterday down the
hill. At one o’clock we came to the <i>Alleghenny</i>, to an old
<i>Shawano</i> town, situated under a high hill on the east,
opposite an island of about one hundred acres, very rich
land, well timbered.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> We looked for a place to cross
the river, but in vain; we then went smartly to work, and
made a raft; we cut the wood, and carried it to the water
side. The wolves and owls made a great noise in the
night.</p>

<p>13th.—We got up early, and boiled some chocolate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
for breakfast, and then began to finish our rafts; we
cloathed ourselves as well as we could in <i>Indian</i> dress; it
was about two o’clock in the afternoon, before we all got
over to the other side, near an old <i>Indian</i> town. The
<i>Indians</i> told us, we should not call Mr. <i>Bull</i>, <i>captain</i>,
their young men would be mad that we brought a warrior
there. We went up a steep hill, good land, to the
creek <i>Cowewanick</i>,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> where we made our fire. They
wanted to hunt for meat, and looked for a road. Captain
<i>Bull</i> shot a squirrel, and broke his gun. I cut fire
wood, and boiled some chocolate for supper. The others
came home, and brought nothing. <i>Pesquitomen</i> wanted
to hear the writing from the general, which we read to
them, to their great satisfaction. This was the first night
we slept in the open air. Mr. <i>Bull</i> took the tent along
with him. We discoursed a good deal of the night
together.</p>

<p>14th.—We rose early, and thought to make good progress
on our way. At one o’clock <i>Thomas Hickman</i> shot
a large buck; and, as our people were hungry for meat,
we made our camp there, and called the water <i>Buck run</i>.
In the evening we heard the great guns fire from <i>fort
Duquesne</i>. Whenever I looked towards that place, I
felt a dismal impression, the very place seemed shocking
and dark. <i>Pesquitomen</i> looked his things over, and found
a white belt, sent by the commissioners of trade,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> for the
<i>Indian</i> affairs. We could find no writing concerning the
belt, and did not know what was the signification thereof:
They seemed much concerned to know it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>15th.—We arose early, and had a good day’s journey:
we passed these two days through thick bushes of briars
and thorns; so that it was very difficult to get through.
We crossed the creek <i>Paquakonink</i>; the land is very indifferent.
At twelve o’clock we crossed the road from
<i>Venango</i> to <i>fort Duquesne</i>. We went west towards
<i>Kushkushking</i>, about sixteen miles from the fort. We
went over a large barren plain, and made our lodging by a
little run. <i>Pesquitomen</i> told us, we must send a messenger,
to let them know of our coming, as the <i>French</i> live
amongst them; he desired a string of wampum; I gave
him three hundred and fifty. We concluded to go within
three miles of <i>Kushkushking</i>, to their sugar cabbins,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
and to call their chiefs there. In discourse, Mr. Bull
told the <i>Indians</i>, the <i>English</i> should let all the prisoners
stay amongst them, that liked to stay.</p>

<p>16th.—We met two <i>Indians</i> on the road, and sat down
with them to dinner. They informed us that no body
was at home, at <i>Kushkushking</i>; that one hundred and
fifty, from that town, were gone to war against our party.
We crossed the above mentioned creek; good land, but
hilly. Went down a long valley to <i>Beaver</i> creek, through
old <i>Kushkushking</i>,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> a large spot of land, about three
miles long; they both went with us to the town; one of
them rode before us, to let the people in the town know
of our coming; we found there but two men, and some
women. Those, that were at home, received us kindly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
<i>Pesquitomen</i> desired us to read the message to them that
were there.</p>

<p>17th.—There were five <i>Frenchmen</i> in the town; the
rest were gone to war. We held a council with <i>Delaware
George</i>, delivered him the string and presents, that
were sent to him; and informed him of the general’s
sentiments, and what he desired of them; upon which he
agreed, and complied to go with Mr. <i>Bull</i>, to the general.
Towards night <i>Keckkenepalin</i> came home from the war,
and told us the disagreeable news, that they had fallen
in with that party, that had guided us; they had killed
Lieutenant <i>Hays</i>, and four more, and took five prisoners,
the others got clear off. They had a skirmish with them
within twelve miles of <i>fort Duquesne</i>. Further he told us,
that one of the captives was to be burnt, which grieved us.
By the prisoners they were informed of our arrival; on
which they concluded to leave the <i>French</i>, and to hear
what news we brought them. In the evening they
brought a prisoner to town. We called the <i>Indians</i>
together, that were at home, and explained the matter to
them, and told them, as their own people had desired
the general to give them a guide to conduct them safe home
and by a misfortune, your people have fallen in with this
party, and killed five and taken five prisoners; and we are
now informed that one of them is to be burnt; “Consider,
my brethren, if you should give us a guide, to bring us
safe on our way home, and our parties should fall in with
you, how hard you would take it.”</p>

<p>They said, “Brother, it is a hard matter, and we are
sorry it hath happened so.” I answered, “Let us therefore
spare no pains to relieve them from any cruelty.”
We could scarce find a messenger, that would undertake
to go to <i>Sawcung</i>, where the prisoner was to be bu[r]nt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
We promised to one named <i>Compass</i>, 500 black wampum,
and Mr. <i>Hays</i> gave him a shirt and a dollar, on which he
promised to go. We sent him as a messenger. By a
string of wampum I spoke these words, “Brethren, consider
the messengers are come home with good news, and
three of your brethren, the <i>English</i>, with them. We desire
you would pity your own young men, women and
children, and use no hardships towards the captives, as
having been guiding our party.”</p>

<p>Afterwards the warriors informed us, that their design
had not been to go to war, but that they had a mind to go
to the general and speak with him; and on the road the
<i>French</i> made a division among them, that they could not
agree; after which they were discovered by the <i>Cherokees</i>
and <i>Catawbas</i>, who fled, and left their bundles, where
they found an <i>English</i> colour. So <i>Kekeuscung</i> told them
he would go before them to the general, if they would
follow him; but they would not agree to it; and the
<i>French</i> persuaded them to fall upon the <i>English</i> at
<i>Loyal-hanning</i>;<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> they accordingly did, and as they were
driven back, they fell in with that party, that guided us,
which they did not know. They seemed very sorry for it.</p>

<p>18th.—Captain <i>Bull</i> acted as commander, without
letting us know any thing, or communicating with us.
He and <i>George</i> relieved a prisoner from the warriors, by
what means I do not know. When the warriors were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
met, he then called us first to sit down, and to hear what
they had to say. The <i>Indian</i> that delivered the prisoner
to <i>Bull</i> and <i>George</i>, spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“My brethren, the <i>English</i> are at such a distance from
us, as if they were under ground, that I cannot hear them.
I am very glad to hear from you such good news; and I
am very sorry that it happened so, that I went to war.
Now I let the general know, he should consider his young
men, and if you should have any of us, to set them at
liberty, so as we do to you.”</p>

<p>Then <i>Pesquitomen</i> said, “As the Governor gave these
three messengers into my bosom, so I now likewise, by
this string of wampum, give <i>Bull</i> into <i>Delaware George’s</i>
bosom, to bring him safe to the general.” Mr. <i>Bull</i>
sat down with the prisoner, who gave him some intelligence
in writing; at which the <i>Indians</i> grew very jealous
and asked them what they had to write there? I wrote
a letter to the general by Mr. <i>Bull</i>. In the afternoon
Mr. <i>Bull</i>, <i>Delaware George</i>, and <i>Keskenepalen</i> set out for
the camp. Towards night they brought in another
prisoner. When Mr. <i>Bull</i> and company were gone, the
<i>Indians</i> took the same prisoner, whom Mr. <i>Bull</i> had
relieved, and bound him and carried him to another
town, without our knowledge. I a thousand times
wished Mr. <i>Bull</i> had never meddled in the affair, fearing
they would exceedingly punish, and bring the prisoner to
confession of the contents of the writing.</p>

<p>19th.—A great many of the warriors came home.
The <i>French</i> had infused bad notions into the <i>Indians</i>, by
means of the letters, they found upon Lieutenant <i>Hays</i>,
who was killed, which they falsely interpreted to them,
viz. That, in one letter it was wrote, that the general
should do all that was in his power to conquer the <i>French</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
and, in the mean time the messengers to the <i>Indians</i>
should do their utmost to draw the Indians back, and
keep them together in conferences, till he, the general,
had made a conquest of the <i>French</i>, and afterwards he
should fall upon all <i>Indians</i>, and destroy them. And,
that, if we should lose our lives, the <i>English</i> would carry
on the war, so long as an <i>Indian</i>, or <i>Frenchman</i> was alive.
Thereupon the French said to the Indians;</p>

<p>“Now you can see, my children, how the <i>English</i> want
to deceive you, and if it would not offend you, I would go
and knock these messengers on the head, before you
should be deceived by them.” One of the <i>Indian</i>
captains spoke to the <i>French</i> and said, “To be sure it
would offend us, if you should offer to knock them on the
head. If you have a mind to go to war, go to the <i>English</i>
army, and knock them on the head, and not these
three men, that come with a message to us.”</p>

<p>After this speech the <i>Indians</i> went all off, and left the
<i>French</i>. Nevertheless it had enraged some of the young
people, and made them suspicious; so that it was a precarious
time for us. I said, “Brethren, have good
courage, and be strong; let not every wind disturb your
mind; let the <i>French</i> bring the letter here; for, as you
cannot read, they may tell you thousands of false stories.
We will read the letter to you. As <i>Isaac Still</i><a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> can read,
he will tell you the truth.”</p>

<p>After this all the young men were gathered together,
<i>Isaac Still</i> being in company. The young men said,
“One that had but half an eye could see that the <i>English</i>
only intended to cheat them; and that it was best
to knock every one of us messengers on the head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>Then <i>Isaac</i> began to speak and said, “I am ashamed
to hear such talking from you; you are but boys like me;
you should not talk of such a thing. There have been
thirteen nations at <i>Easton</i>, where they have established
a firm peace with the <i>English</i>; and I have heard that the
Five Nations were always called the wisest; go tell them
that they are fools, and cannot see; and tell them that you
are kings, and wise men. Go and tell the <i>Cayuga</i> chiefs
so, that are here; and you will become great men.”
Afterwards they were all still, and said not one word more.</p>

<p>20th.—There came a great many more together in
the town, and brought <i>Henry Osten</i>, the sergeant, who
was to have been burnt. They hallooed the war halloo;
and the men and women beat him till he came into the
house.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It is a grievous and melancholy sight to see our
fellow mortals so abused. <i>Isaac Still</i> had a long discourse
with the <i>French</i> captain; who made himself great,
by telling how he had fought the <i>English</i> at <i>Loyal-Hanning</i>.
<i>Isaac</i> rallied him, and said he had seen them
scalp horses, and take others for food. The first he
denied, but the second he owned. <i>Isaac</i> ran the captain
quite down, before them all. The <i>French</i> captain spoke
with the two <i>Cayugas</i>; at last the <i>Cayugas</i> spoke very
sharp to him, so that he grew pale, and was quite silent.</p>

<p>These three days past was precarious time for us. We
were warned not to go far from the house; because the
people who came from the slaughter, having been driven
back, were possessed with a murdering spirit; which led
them as in a halter, in which they were catched, and
with bloody vengeance were thirsty and drunk. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
afforded a melancholy prospect. <i>Isaac Still</i> was himself
dubious of our lives. We did not let Mr. <i>Hays</i>
know of the danger. I said, “As God hath stopped the
mouth of the lions, that they could not devour <i>Daniel</i>, so
he will preserve us from their fury, and bring us through.”
I had a discourse with Mr. <i>Hays</i> concerning our message,
and begged him he would pray to God for grace and wisdom,
that he would grant us peace among this people.
We will remain in stillness, and not look to our own
credit. We are in the service of our king and country.
This people are rebellious in heart.</p>

<p>Now we are here to reconcile them again to the
General, Governor, and the <i>English</i> nation; to turn them
again from their errors. And I wished that God would
grant us his grace, whereby we may do it; which I hope
and believe he will do. Mr. <i>Hays</i> took it to heart and
was convinced of all; which much rejoiced me. I begged
<i>Isaac Still</i> to watch over himself and not to be discouraged;
for I hoped the storm would soon pass by.</p>

<p>In the afternoon all the captains gathered together in
the middle town; they sent for us, and desired we should
give them information of our message. Accordingly we
did. We read the message with great satisfaction to
them. It was a great pleasure both to them and us.
The number of captains and counsellors were sixteen.
In the evening messengers arrived from <i>fort Duquesne</i>,
with a string of wampum from the commander; upon
which they all came together in the house where we
lodged. The messengers delivered their string, with
these words from their father, the <i>French</i> King:</p>

<p>“My children, come to me, and hear what I have to
say. The <i>English</i> are coming with an army to destroy
both you and me. I therefore desire you immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
my children, to hasten with all the young men; we will
drive the <i>English</i> and destroy them. I, as a father, will
tell you always what is best.” He laid the string before
one of the captains. After a little conversation, the captain
stood up and said; “I have just heard something of
our brethren the <i>English</i>, which pleaseth me much better.
I will not go. Give it to the others, may be they will go.”
The messenger took up again the string and said, “He
won’t go, he has heard of the <i>English</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Then all
cried out, “yes, yes, we have heard from the <i>English</i>.”
He then threw the string to the other fire place, where the
other captains were; but they kicked it from one to
another, as if it was a snake. Captain <i>Peter</i> took a
stick, and with it flung the string from one end of the
room to the other,<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and said, “Give it to the <i>French</i>
captain, and let him go with his young men; he boasted
much of his fighting; now let us see his fighting. We
have often ventured our lives for him; and had hardly
a loaf of bread, when we came to him; and now he thinks
we should jump to serve him.” Then we saw the <i>French</i>
captain mortified to the uttermost; he looked as pale as
death. The Indians discoursed and joked till midnight;
and the <i>French</i> captain sent messengers at midnight to
<i>fort Duquesne</i>.</p>

<p>21st.—We were informed that the general was within
twenty miles of <i>fort Duquesne</i>. As the <i>Indians</i> were
afraid the <i>English</i> would come over the river <i>Ohio</i>, I
spoke with some of the captains, and told them that,
“I supposed the general intended to surround the <i>French</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
and therefore must come to this side the river; but we
assure you that he will not come to your towns to hurt
you.” I begged them to let the <i>Shawanese</i> at <i>Logstown</i>,
know it, and gave them four strings of 300 wampum,
with this message; “Brethren, we are arrived with good
news, waiting for you; we desire you to be strong, and
remember the ancient friendship your grandfathers had
with the <i>English</i>. We wish you would remember it, and
pity your young men, women and children, and keep
away from the <i>French</i>; and if the <i>English</i> should come
to surround the <i>French</i>, be not afraid. We assure you
they won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>22d.—<i>Kittiuskund</i> came home, and sent for us, being
very glad to see us. He informed us, the general was
within fifteen miles of the <i>French fort</i>; that the <i>French</i>
had uncovered their houses, and laid the roofs round the
fort to set it on fire, and made ready to go off, and would
demolish the fort, and let the <i>English</i> have the bare
ground; saying; “they are not able to build a strong fort
this winter; and we will be early enough in the spring
to destroy them. We will come with seventeen nations
of <i>Indians</i>, and a great many <i>French</i>, and build a stone
fort.”</p>

<p>The Indians danced round the fire till midnight, for
joy of their brethren, the <i>English</i>, coming. There went
some scouting parties towards the army. Some of the
captains told me, that <i>Shamokin Daniel</i>, who came
with me in my former journey, had fairly sold me to the
<i>French</i>; and the <i>French</i> had been very much displeased
that the <i>Indians</i> had brought me away.</p>

<p>23d.—The <i>liar</i> raised a story, as if the <i>English</i> were
divided into three bodies, to come on this side the river.
They told us the <i>Cayugas</i>, that came with us, had said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
so. We told the <i>Cayugas</i> of it; on which they called
the other <i>Indians</i> together; denied that they ever said so;
and said, they were sent to this place from the <i>Five
Nations</i>, to tell them to do their best endeavors to send
the <i>French</i> off from this country; and when that was done
they would go and tell the general to go back over the
mountains.</p>

<p>I see the <i>Indians</i> concern themselves very much about
the affair of land; and are continually jealous, and afraid
the <i>English</i> will take their land. I told them to be still
and content themselves, “for there are some chiefs
of the <i>Five Nations</i> with the army; they will settle the
affair, as they are the chief owners of the land; and it will
be well for you to come and speak with the general
yourselves.”</p>

<p><i>Isaac Still</i> asked the <i>French</i> captain, whether it was
true, that <i>Daniel</i> had sold me to the <i>French</i>? He owned
it, and said, I was theirs, they had bought me fairly; and,
if the <i>Indians</i> would give them leave, he would take me.</p>

<p>24th.—We hanged out the <i>English</i> flag, in spite of the
<i>French</i>; on which our prisoners folded their hands, in
hopes that their redemption was nigh, looking up to
God, which melted my heart in tears, and prayers to
God, to hear their prayers, and change the times, and the
situation, which our prisoners are in, and under which
they groan. “O Lord, said they, when will our redemption
come, that we shall be delivered, and return home?”—And
if any accident happeneth, which the <i>Indians</i>
dislike, the prisoners all tremble with fear, saying, “Lord,
what will become of us, and what will be the end of our
lives?” So that they often wish themselves rather under
the ground, than in this life. King Beaver came home,
and called us to his house, and saluted us in a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
manner; which we, in like manner, did to him. Afterwards
I spoke by four strings of 350 wampum, and said,
as followeth:</p>

<p>“I have a salutation to you, and all your people, from
the general, the governor, and many other gentlemen.
Brother, it pleases me that the day is come to see you and
your people. We have warmed ourselves by your fire,
and waited for you, and thank you, that you did come
home. We have good news of great importance; which
we hope will make you, and all your people’s hearts glad.
By these strings I desire you would be pleased to call all
your kings and captains, from all the towns and nations;
so that they all may hear us, and have the benefit thereof,
while they live, and their children after them.”</p>

<p>Then he said, “As soon as I heard of your coming, I
rose up directly to come to you.” Then there came
another message, which called me to another place, where
six kings of six nations were met together. I sent them
word, they should sit together a while, and smoke their
pipes, and I would come to them. King Beaver said
further,</p>

<p>“Brother, it pleaseth me to hear that you brought
such good news; and my heart rejoices already at what
you said to me. It rejoices me that I have now heard of
you.” I said, “Brother, you did well, that you first
came here, before you went to the kings; as the good
news we brought is to all nations, from the rising of the
sun to the going down of the same; that want to be in
peace and friendship with the <i>English</i>. So it will give
them satisfaction, when they hear it.” The <i>French</i>
captain told us, that they would demolish the fort; and
he thought the <i>English</i> would be to-day at the place.</p>

<p>25th.—<i>Shingas</i> came home, and saluted us in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
friendly manner, and so did <i>Beaver</i>, in our house; and
then they told us, they would hear our message; and we
perceived that the <i>French</i> captain had an inclination to
hear it. We called <i>Beaver</i> and <i>Shingas</i>, and informed
them, that all the nations, at <i>Easton</i>, had agreed with the
governor, that every thing should be kept secret from the
ears and eyes of the <i>French</i>. He said, “it was no matter,
they were beaten already. It is good news, and if he
would say any thing, we would tell him what friendship
we have together.” Accordingly they met together, and
the <i>French</i> captain was present. The number consisted
of about fifty.</p>

<p>King <i>Beaver</i> first spoke to his men, “Hearken, all you
captains and warriors, here are our brethren, the <i>English</i>;
I wish that you may give attention, and take notice
of what they say. As it is for our good, that there may
an everlasting peace be established, although there is
a great deal of mischief done, if it pleaseth God to help
us, we may live in peace again.”</p>

<p>Then I began to speak by four strings to them, and
said,</p>

<p>“Brethren, being come here to see you, I perceive your
bodies are all stained with blood, and observe tears and
sorrows in your eyes: With this string I clean your
body from blood, and wipe and anoint your eyes with the
healing oil, so that you may see your brethren clearly.
And as so many storms have blown since we last saw one
another, and we are at such a distance from you, that you
could not rightly hear us as yet, I, by this string, take a
soft feather, and with that good oil, our grandfathers
used, open and clear your ears, so that you may both
hear and understand what your brethren have to say to
you. And by these strings I clear your throat from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
dust, and take all the bitterness out of your heart, and
clear the passage from the heart to the throat, that you
may speak freely with your brethren, the <i>English</i>, from
the heart.”</p>

<p>Then <i>Isaac Still</i> gave the pipe, sent by the <i>Friends</i>,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
filled with tobacco, and handed round, after their custom,
and said:</p>

<p>“Brethren, here is the pipe, which your grandfathers
used to smoke with, when they met together in councils of
peace. And here is some of that good tobacco, prepared
for our grandfathers from God:—When you shall taste
of it, you shall feel it through all your body; and it will
put you in remembrance of the good councils, your grandfathers
used to hold with the <i>English</i>, your brethren, and
that ancient friendship, they had together.”</p>

<p>King <i>Beaver</i> rose, and thanked us first, that we had
cleared his body from the blood, and wiped the tears
and sorrow from his eyes, and opened his ears, so that
now he could well hear and understand. Likewise he
returned thanks for the <i>pipe and tobacco</i>, that we brought,
which our grandfathers used to smoke. He said,—“When
I tasted that good tobacco, I felt it all through
my body, and it made me all over well.”</p>

<p>Then we delivered the messages, as followeth:</p>

<p>Governor <i>Denny’s</i> answer to the message of the <i>Ohio
Indians</i>, brought by <i>Frederick Post</i>, <i>Pesquitomen</i> and
<i>Thomas Hickman</i>.</p>

<p>“By this string, my <i>Indian</i> brethren of the United
Nations and <i>Delawares</i>, join with me, in requiring of
the <i>Indian</i> councils, to which these following messages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
shall be presented, to keep every thing private from the
eyes and ears of the <i>French</i>.” A string.</p>

<p>“Brethren, we received your message by <i>Pesquitomen</i>
and <i>Frederick Post</i>, and thank you for the care you have
taken of our messenger of peace, and that you have put
him in your bosom, and protected him against our enemy,
<i>Onontio</i>, and his children, and sent him safe back to our
council fire, by the same man, that received him from
us.” A string.</p>

<p>“Brethren, I only sent <i>Post</i> to peep into your cabbins,
and to know the sentiments of your old men, and to
look at your faces, to see how you look. And I am glad
to hear from him, that you look friendly; and that there
still remain some sparks of love towards us. It was what
we believed before hand, and therefore we never let
slip the chain of friendship, but held it fast, on our side,
and it has never dropt out of our hands. By this belt we
desire that you will dig up your end of the chain of friendship,
that you suffered, by the subtlety of the <i>French</i>, to
be buried.” A belt.</p>

<p>“Brethren, it happened that the governor of <i>Jersey</i>
was with me, and a great many <i>Indian</i> brethren, sitting
in council at <i>Easton</i>, when your messengers arrived;
and it gave pleasure to every one that heard it; and it will
afford the same satisfaction to our neighboring governors,
and their people, when they come to hear it. I shall
send messengers to them, and acquaint them with what
you have said.</p>

<p>“Your requesting us to let the king of <i>England</i> know
your good dispositions we took to heart, and shall let
him know it; and we will speak in your favor to his
majesty, who has, for some time past, looked upon you
as his lost children. And we can assure you, that, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
a tender father over all his children, he will forgive what
is past, and receive you again into his arms.” A belt.</p>

<p>“Brethren, if you are in earnest to be reconciled to us,
you will keep your young men from attacking our country
and killing and carrying captive our back inhabitants;
And will likewise give orders, that your people may be
kept at a distance from <i>Fort Duquesne</i>; that they may
not be hurt by our warriors, who are sent by our king to
chastise the <i>French</i>, and not to hurt you. Consider the
commanding officer of that army treads heavy, and
would be very sorry to hurt any of his <i>Indian</i> brethren.”
A large belt.</p>

<p>“And brethren, the chiefs of the <i>United Nations</i>,
with their cousins, our brethren, the <i>Delawares</i>, and
others now here, jointly with me send this belt, which
has upon it two figures, that represent all the <i>English</i>,
and all the <i>Indians</i>, now present, taking hands, and delivering
it to <i>Pesquitomen</i>: and we desire it may be likewise
sent to the <i>Indians</i>, who are named at the end of these
messages;<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> as they have all been formerly our very good
friends and allies; and we desire they will all go from
among the <i>French</i> to their own towns, and no longer help
the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Brethren on the Ohio</i>, if you take the belts we just
now gave you, in which all here join, <i>English</i> and <i>Indians</i>,
as we do not doubt you will; then, by this belt, I make
a road for you, and invite you to come to <i>Philadelphia</i>,
to your first old council fire, which was kindled when we
first saw one another; which fire we will kindle up again,
and remove all disputes, and renew the old and first treaties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
of friendship. This is a clear and open road for you;
fear, therefore, nothing, and come to us with as many as
can be of the <i>Delawares</i>, <i>Shawanese</i>, or of the <i>Six Nations</i>:
We will be glad to see you; we desire all tribes
and nations of <i>Indians</i>, who are in alliance with you, may
come. As soon as we hear of your coming, of which you
will give us timely notice, we will lay up provisions for
you along the road.”</p>

<p>A large white belt, with the figure of a man, at each end,
and streaks of black, representing the road from the <i>Ohio</i>
to <i>Philadelphia</i>.</p>

<p>“Brethren, the <i>Six Nation</i> and <i>Delaware</i> chiefs join
with me in those belts, which are tied together, to signify
our union and friendship for each other; with them we
jointly take the <i>tomahawks</i> out of your hands, and bury
them under ground.</p>

<p>“We speak aloud, so as you may hear us; you see
we all stand together, joined hand in hand.” Two belts
tied together.</p>

<p>“General <i>Forbes</i> to the <i>Shawanese</i>, and <i>Delawares</i>, on
the <i>Ohio</i>.</p>

<p>“Brethren, I embrace this opportunity by our brother,
<i>Pesquitomen</i>, who is now on his return home with some
of your uncles, of the <i>Six Nations</i>, from the treaty of
<i>Easton</i>, of giving you joy of the happy conclusion of that
great council, which is perfectly agreeable to me; as it is
for the mutual advantage of our brethren, the <i>Indians</i>,
as well as the <i>English</i> nation.</p>

<p>“I am glad to find that all past disputes and animosities
are now finally settled, and amicably adjusted; and
I hope they will be for ever buried in oblivion, and that
you will now again be firmly united in the interest of
your brethren, the <i>English</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>“As I am now advancing, at the head of a large army,
against his majesty’s enemies, the <i>French</i>, on the <i>Ohio</i>,
I must strongly recommend to you to send immediate
notice to any of your people, who may be at the <i>French</i>
fort, to return forthwith to your towns; where you may
sit by your fires, with your wives and children, quiet and
undisturbed, and smoke your pipes in safety. Let the
<i>French</i> fight their own battles, as they were the first cause
of the war, and the occasion of the long difference, which
hath subsisted between you and your brethren, the <i>English</i>;
but I must entreat you to restrain your young men
from crossing the <i>Ohio</i>, as it will be impossible for me
to distinguish them from our enemies; which I expect you
will comply with, without delay; lest, by your neglect
thereof, I should be the innocent cause of some of our
brethren’s death. This advice take and keep in your
own breasts, and suffer it not to reach the ears of the
<i>French</i>.</p>

<p>“As a proof of the truth and sincerity of what I say,
and to confirm the tender regard I have for the lives and
welfare of our brethren, on the <i>Ohio</i>, I send you this
string of wampum.</p>

<p>“I am, brethren and warriors,</p>

<p class="center">“Your friend and brother,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">John Forbes</span>.”</p>

<p>“Brethren, kings <i>Beaver</i> and <i>Shingas</i>, and all the
warriors, who join with you:</p>

<p>“The many acts of hostility, committed by the <i>French</i>
against the <i>British</i> subjects, made it necessary for the
king to take up arms, in their defence, and to redress
their wrongs, which have been done them; heaven hath
favoured the justice of the cause, and given success to
his fleets and armies, in different parts of the world. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
have received his commands, with regard to what is to be
done on the <i>Ohio</i>, and shall endeavour to act like a soldier
by driving the <i>French</i> from thence, or destroying them.</p>

<p>“It is a particular pleasure to me to learn, that the
<i>Indians</i>, who inhabit near that river, have lately concluded
a treaty of peace with the <i>English</i>; by which the
ancient friendship is renewed with their brethren, and
fixed on a firmer foundation than ever. May it be lasting
and unmoveable as the mountains. I make no doubt
but it gives you equal satisfaction, and that you will
unite your endeavours with mine, and all the governors
of these provinces, to strengthen it: The clouds, that,
for some time, hung over the <i>English</i>, and their friends,
the <i>Indians</i> on the <i>Ohio</i>, and kept them both in darkness,
are now dispersed, and the chearful light now again
shines upon us, and warms us both. May it continue to
do so, while the sun and moon give light.</p>

<p>“Your people, who were sent to us, were received by
us with open arms; they were kindly entertained, while
they were here; and I have taken care that they shall
return safe to you; with them come trusty messengers,
whom I earnestly recommend to your protection; they
have several matters in charge; and I desire you may give
credit to what they say; in particular, they have a large
belt of wampum, and by this belt we let you know, that
it is agreed by me, and all the governors, that there shall
be an everlasting peace with all the <i>Indians</i>, established
as sure as the mountains, between the <i>English</i> nation and
the <i>Indians</i>, all over, from the sun rising to the sun setting;
and as your influence on them is great, so you will make
it known to all the different nations, that want to be in
friendship with the <i>English</i>; and I hope, by your means
and persuasions, many will lay hold on this belt, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
immediately withdraw from the <i>French</i>; this will be
greatly to their own interest and your honor, and I shall
not fail to acquaint the great king of it: I sincerely wish
it, for their good; for it will fill me with concern, to find
any of you joined with the <i>French</i>; as in that case, you
must be sensible I must treat them as enemies; however,
I once more repeat, that there is no time to be lost; for I
intend to march with the army very soon; and I hope to
enjoy the pleasure of thanking you for your zeal, and of
entertaining you in the fort ere long. In the mean time
I wish happiness and prosperity to you, your women
and children.</p>

<p>“I write to you as a warrior should, that is, with candour
and love, and I recommend secrecy and dispatch.</p>

<p>“I am, kings <i>Beaver</i> and <i>Shingas</i>,</p>

<p>”And brother warriors,</p>

<p class="center">“Your assured friend and brother,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">John Forbes</span>.”</p>

<p>“From my camp at <span class="smcap">Loyalhannon</span>, Nov. 9, 1758.”</p>

<p>The messages pleased, and gave satisfaction to all the
hearers, except the <i>French</i> captain. He shook his head
with bitter grief, and often changed his countenance.
<i>Isaac Still</i> ran down the <i>French</i> captain with great
boldness, and pointed at him saying, “There he sits.”
Afterwards <i>Shingas</i> rose up and said:</p>

<p>“Brethren, now we have rightly heard and understood
you, it pleaseth me and all the young men, that hear it;
we shall think of it, and take it into due consideration;
and when we have considered it well, then we will give
you an answer, and send it to all the towns and nations,
as you desired us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>We thanked them and wished them good success in
their undertaking; and wished it might have the same
effect upon all other nations, that may hereafter hear it,
as it had on them. We went a little out of the house.
In the mean time <i>Isaac Still</i> demanded the letter, which
the <i>French</i> had falsely interpreted, that it might be read in
public. Then they called us back, and I, <i>Frederick
Post</i>, found it was my own letter, I had wrote to the
general. I therefore stood up, and read it, which Isaac
interpreted. The <i>Indians</i> were well pleased, and took
it as if it was written to them; thereupon they all said:
“We always thought the <i>French</i> report of the letter was a
lie; they always deceived us:” Pointing at the <i>French</i>
captain; who, bowing down his head, turned quite pale,
and could look no one in the face. All the <i>Indians</i>
began to mock and laugh at him; he could hold it no
longer, and went out. Then the <i>Cayuga</i> chief delivered
a string, in the name of the <i>Six Nations</i>, with these
words:</p>

<p>“Cousins, hear what I have to say; I see you are sorry,
and the tears stand in your eyes. I would open your ears,
and clear your eyes from tears, so that you may see, and
hear what your uncles, the <i>Six Nations</i>, have to say.
We have established a friendship with your brethren,
the <i>English</i>. We see that you are all over bloody, on
your body; I clean the heart from the dust, and your eyes
from the tears, and your bodies from the blood, that you
may hear and see your brethren, the <i>English</i>, and appear
clean before them, and that you may speak from the
heart with them.” Delivered four strings.</p>

<p>Then he shewed to them a string from the <i>Cherokees</i>,
with these words:</p>

<p>“Nephews, we let you know, that we are exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
glad that there is such a firm friendship established, on
so good a foundation, with so many nations, that it will
last for ever; and, as the <i>Six Nations</i> have agreed with
the <i>English</i>, so we wish that you may lay hold of the same
friendship. We will remind you, that we were formerly
good friends. Likewise we let you know, that the <i>Six
Nations</i> gave us a <i>tomahawk</i>, and, if any body offended
us, we should strike him with it; likewise they gave me a
knife, to take off the scalp. So we let you know, that we
are desirous to hear very soon from you, what you determine.
It may be we shall use the hatchet very soon,
therefore I long to hear from you.”</p>

<p>Then the council broke up. After a little while messengers
arrived, and <i>Beaver</i> came into our house, and
gave us the pleasure to hear, that the <i>English</i> had the
field, and that the <i>French</i> had demolished and burnt the
place entirely, and went off; that the commander is gone
with two hundred men to <i>Venango</i>, and the rest gone
down the river in battoes, to the lower <i>Shawanese</i> town,
with an intention to build a fort there; they were seen
yesterday passing by <i>Sawcung</i>.</p>

<p>We ended this day with pleasure and great satisfaction
on both sides: the <i>Cayuga</i> chief said, he would speak
further to them tomorrow.</p>

<p>26th.—We met together about ten o’clock. First,
King <i>Beaver</i> addressed himself to the <i>Cayuga</i> chief, and
said;</p>

<p>“My uncles, as it is customary to answer one another,
so I thank you, that you took so much notice of your
cousins, and that you have wiped the tears from our eyes,
and cleaned our bodies from the blood; when you spoke
to me I saw myself all over bloody; and since you cleaned
me I feel myself quite pleasant through my whole body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
and I can see the sun shine clear over us.” Delivered
four strings.</p>

<p>He said further, “As you took so much pains, and
came a great way through the bushes, I, by this string,
clean you from the sweat, and clean the dust out of your
throat, so that you may speak what you have to say from
your brethren, the <i>English</i>, and our uncles, the <i>Six
Nations</i>, to your cousins, I am ready to hear.”</p>

<p>Then <i>Petiniontonka</i>, the <i>Cayuga</i> chief, took the belt
with eight diamonds,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and said;</p>

<p>“Cousins, take notice of what I have to say; we let
you know what agreement we have made with our brethren,
the <i>English</i>. We had almost slipt and dropt the
chain of friendship with our brethren, the <i>English</i>; now
we let you know that we have renewed the peace and
friendship with our brethren, the <i>English</i>; and we have
made a new agreement with them. We see that you have
dropt the peace and friendship with them. We desire
you would lay hold of the covenant, we have made with
our brethren, the <i>English</i>, and be strong. We likewise
take the <i>tomahawk</i> out of your hands, that you received
from the white people; use it no longer; fling the <i>tomahawk</i>
away; it is the white people’s; let them use it among
themselves; it is theirs, and they are of one colour; let
them fight with one another, and do you be still and
quiet in <i>Kushkushking</i>. Let our grandchildren, the
<i>Shawanese</i>, likewise know of the covenant, we established
with our friends, the English, and also let all other
nations know it.”</p>

<p>Then he explained to them the eight diamonds, on the
belt, signifying the five united nations, and the three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
younger nations, which join them; these all united with
the <i>English</i>. Then he proceeded thus:</p>

<p>“Brethren,” (delivering a belt with eight diamonds,
the second belt) “we hear that you did not sit right; and
when I came I found you in a moving posture, ready to
jump towards the sunset; so we will set you at ease, and
quietly down, that you may sit well at <i>Kushkushking</i>;
and we desire you to be strong; and if you will be strong,
your women and children will see from day to day the
light shining more over them; and our children and
grand children will see that there will be an everlasting
peace established. We desire you to be still; we do not
know as yet, what to do; towards the spring you shall
hear from your uncles what they conclude; in the mean
time do you sit still by your fire at <i>Kushkushking</i>.”</p>

<p>In the evening the devil made a general disturbance, to
hinder them in their good disposition. It was reported
that they saw three <i>Catawba Indians</i> in their town; and
they roved about all that cold night, in great fear and
confusion. When I consider with what tyranny and
power the prince of this world rules over this people, it
breaks my heart over them, and that their redemption
may draw nigh, and open their eyes, that they may see
what bondage they are in, and deliver them from the
evil.</p>

<p>27th.—We waited all the day for an answer. <i>Beaver</i>
came and told us, “They were busy all the day long.”
He said, “It is a great matter, and wants much consideration.
We are three tribes, which must separately agree
among ourselves; it takes time before we hear each agreement,
and the particulars thereof.” He desired us to
read our message once more to them in private; we told
them, we were at their service at any time; and then we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
explained him the whole again. There arrived a messenger
from <i>Sawcung</i>, and informed us that four of their people
were gone to our camp, to see what the <i>English</i> were
about; and that one of them climbing upon a tree was
discovered by falling down; and then our people spoke to
them; three resolved to go to the other side, and one came
back and brought the news, which pleased the company.
Some of the captains and counsellors were together; they
said, that the <i>French</i> would build a strong fort, at the
lower <i>Shawanese</i> town. I answered them, “Brethren,
if you suffer the French to build a fort there, you must
suffer likewise the <i>English</i> to come and destroy the place;
<i>English</i> will follow the <i>French</i>, and pursue them, let it
cost whatever it will; and wherever the <i>French</i> settle, the
<i>English</i> will follow and destroy them.”</p>

<p>They said, “We think the same, and would endeavour
to prevent it, if the <i>English</i> only would go back, after
having drove away the <i>French</i>, and not settle there.” I
said, “I can tell you no certainty in this affair; it is best for
you to go with us to the general, and speak with him. So
much I know, that they only want to establish a trade with
you; and you know yourselves that you cannot do without
being supplied with such goods as you stand in need of;
but, brethren, be assured you must entirely quit the
<i>French</i>, and have no communication with them, else they
will always breed disturbance and confusion amongst
you, and persuade your young people to go to war against
our brethren, the <i>English</i>.”</p>

<p>I spoke with them further about <i>Venango</i>, and said,
I believed the <i>English</i> would go there, if they suffered
the <i>French</i> longer to live there. This speech had much
influence on them, and they said; “We are convinced of
all that you have said; it will be so.” I found them inclined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
to send off the <i>French</i> from <i>Venango</i>; but they
wanted first to know the disposition of the <i>English</i>, and
not to suffer the <i>French</i> to build any where.</p>

<p>28th.—King <i>Beaver</i> arose early before the break of
day, and bid all his people a good morning, desired them
to rise early and prepare victuals; for they had to answer
their brethren, the <i>English</i>, and their uncles, and therefore
they should be in a good humor and disposition.
At ten o’clock they met together; <i>Beaver</i> addressed himself
to his people, and said,</p>

<p>“Take notice all you young men and warriors to what
we answer now: it is three days since we heard our
brethren, the <i>English</i>, and our uncles; and what we
have heard of both, is very good; and we are all much
pleased with what we have heard. Our uncles have
made an agreement, and peace is established with our
brethren, the <i>English</i>, and they have shook hands with
them; and we likewise agree in the peace and friendship,
they have established between them.” Then he spoke
to the <i>French</i> captain <i>Canaquais</i>, and said,</p>

<p>“You may hear what I answer; it is good news, that
we have heard. I have not made myself a king. My
uncles have made me like a queen, that I always should
mind what is good and right, and whatever I agree with,
they will assist me, and help me through. Since the
warriors came amongst us, I could not follow that which
is good and right; which has made me heavy; and since
it is my duty to do that which is good, so I will endeavour
to do and to speak what is good, and not let myself be
disturbed by the warriors.”</p>

<p>Then he spoke to the <i>Mingoes</i>, and said,</p>

<p>“My uncles, hear me; It is two days since you told me,
that you have made peace and friendship, and shook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
hands with our brethren, the <i>English</i>. I am really very
much pleased with what you told me; and I join with
you in the same; and, as you said, I should let the <i>Shawanese</i>
and <i>Delamaitanoes</i> know of the agreement, you have
made with our brethren, the <i>English</i>, I took it to heart,
and shall let them know it very soon.” He delivered a
string.</p>

<p>“Look now, my uncles, and hear what your cousins
say: you have spoke the day before yesterday to me. I
have heard you. You told me, you would set me at
<i>Kushkushking</i> easy down. I took it to heart; and I
shall do so, and be still, and lay myself easy down, and
keep my match-coat close to my breast. You told me,
you will let me know in the next spring, what to do; so I
will be still, and wait to hear from you.” Gave him a
belt.</p>

<p>Then he turned himself to us, and gave us the following
answers. First, to the general;</p>

<p>“Brother, by these strings I would desire, in a most
kind and friendly manner, you would be pleased to hear
me what I have to say, as you are not far off.</p>

<p>“Brother, now you told me you have heard of that
good agreement, that has been agreed to, at the treaty
at Easton; and that you have put your hands to it, to
strengthen it, so that it may last for ever. Brother, you
have told me, that after you have come to hear it, you
have taken it to heart, and then you sent it to me, and let
me know it. Brother, I would desire you would be
pleased to hear me, and I would tell you, in a most soft,
loving and friendly manner, to go back over the mountain,
and to stay there; for, if you will do that, I will use it for
an argument, to argue with other nations of <i>Indians</i>.
Now, brother, you have told me you have made a road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
clear, from the sun-set to our first old council fire, at
<i>Philadelphia</i>, and therefore I should fear nothing, and
come into that road. Brother, after these far <i>Indians</i>
shall come to hear of that good and wide road, that you
have laid out for us, then they will turn and look at the
road, and see nothing in the way; and that is the reason
that maketh me tell you to go back over the mountain
again, and to stay there; for then the road will be clear, and
nothing in the way.”</p>

<p>Then he addressed himself to the Governor of <i>Pennsylvania</i>,
as follows;</p>

<p>“Brother, give good attention to what I am going to
say; for I speak from my heart; and think nothing the less
of it, though the strings be small.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>“Brother, I now tell you what I have heard from you
is quite agreeable to my mind; and I love to hear you. I
tell you likewise, that all the chief men of <i>Allegheny</i> are
well pleased with what you have said to us; and all my
young men, women and children, that are able to understand,
are well pleased with what you have said to me.</p>

<p>“Brother, you tell me that all the Governors of the
several provinces have agreed to a well established and
everlasting peace with the <i>Indians</i>; and you likewise tell
me, that my uncles, the <i>Six Nations</i>, and my brethren
the <i>Delawares</i>, and several other tribes of <i>Indians</i> join
with you in it, to establish it, so that it may be everlasting;
you likewise tell me, you have all agreed on a treaty of
peace to last for ever; and for these reasons I tell you,
I am pleased with what you have told me.</p>

<p>“Brother, I am heartily pleased to hear that you never
let slip the chain of friendship out of your hands, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
our grandfathers had between them, so that they could
agree as brethren and friends in any thing.</p>

<p>“Brother, as you have been pleased to let me know of
that good and desirable agreement, that you and my
uncles and brothers have agreed to, at the treaty of peace,
I now tell you I heartily join and agree in it, and to it;
and now I desire you to go on steadily in that great and
good work, you have taken in hand; and I will do as you
desire me to do; that is, to let the other tribes of <i>Indians</i>
know it, and more especially my uncles, the <i>Six Nations</i>,
and the <i>Shawanese</i>, my grandchildren, and all other
nations, settled to the westward.</p>

<p>“Brother, I desire you not to be out of patience, as I
have a great many friends at a great distance; and I
shall use my best endeavours to let them know it as soon
as possible; and as soon as I obtain their answer, shall
let you know it.” Then he gave six strings all white.</p>

<p>In the evening arrived a messenger from <i>Sackung</i>,
<i>Netodwehement</i>, and desired they should make all the
haste to dispatch us, and we should come to <i>Sackung</i>;
for, as they did not know what is become of those three,
that went to our camp, they were afraid the <i>English</i>
would keep them, till they heard what was become of us,
their messengers.</p>

<p>29th.—Before day break <i>Beaver</i> and <i>Shingas</i> came,
and called us into their council. They had been all the
night together. They said; “Brethren, now is the day
coming, you will set off from here. It is a good many
days since we heard you; and what we have heard is very
pleasing and agreeable to us. It rejoices all our hearts;
and all our young men, women and children, that are
capable to understand, are really very well pleased with
what they have heard; it is so agreeable to us, that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
never received such good news before; we think God has
made it so; he pities us, and has mercy on us. And now,
brethren, you desire that I should let it be known to all
other nations; and I shall let them know very soon.
Therefore <i>Shingas</i> cannot go with you. He must go
with me, to help me in this great work; and I shall send
nobody, but go myself, to make it known to all nations.”</p>

<p>Then we thanked them for their care; and wished him
good success on his journey and undertaking: and, as
this message had such a good effect on them, we hoped
it would have the same on all other nations, when they
came to hear it. I hoped that all the clouds would pass
away, and the chearful light would shine over all nations;
so I wished them good assistance and help on their
journey. Farther, he said to us;</p>

<p>“Now we desire you to be strong;<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> because I shall
make it my strong argument with other nations; but as we
have given credit to what you have said, hoping it is true,
and we agree to it; if it should prove the contrary, it
would make me so ashamed, that I never could lift up
my head, and never undertake to speak any word more
for the interest of the <i>English</i>.”</p>

<p>I told them, “Brethren, you will remember that it was
wrote to you by the general, that you might give credit
to what we say; so I am glad to hear of you, that you give
credit; and we assure you, that what we have told you is
the truth; and you will find it so.”</p>

<p>They said further, “Brethren, we let you know, that
the <i>French</i> have used our people kindly, in every respect;
they have used them like gentlemen, especially those that
live near them. So they have treated the chiefs. Now we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
desire you to be strong; we wish you would take the same
method, and use our people well: for the other <i>Indians</i>
will look upon us;<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and we do not otherwise know how
to convince them, and to bring them into the <i>English</i>
interest, without your using such means as will convince
them. For the <i>French</i> will still do more to keep them to
their interest.”</p>

<p>I told them, “I would take it to heart, and inform the
Governor, and other gentlemen of it; and speak to them
in their favour.” Then they said, “It is so far well, and
the road is cleared; but they thought we should send
them another call, when they may come.” I told them;
“We did not know when they would have agreed with
the other nations. Brother, it is you, who must give us
the first notice when you can come; the sooner the better;
and so soon as you send us word, we will prepare for you
on the road.” After this we made ready for our journey.</p>

<p><i>Ketiushund</i>, a noted <i>Indian</i>, one of the chief counsellors,
told us in secret, “That all the nations had jointly agreed
to defend their hunting place at <i>Alleghenny</i>, and suffer
nobody to settle there; and as these <i>Indians</i> are very
much inclined to the <i>English</i> interest, so he begged us
very much to tell the Governor, General, and all other
people not to settle there. And if the <i>English</i> would
draw back over the mountain, they would get all the
other nations into their interest; but if they staid and
settled there, all the nations would be against them; and
he was afraid it would be a great war, and never come to
a peace again.”</p>

<p>I promised to inform the Governor, General, and all
other people of it, and repeated my former request to
them, not to suffer any <i>French</i> to settle amongst them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
After we had fetched our horses, we went from <i>Kushkushking</i>,
and came at five o’clock to <i>Saccung</i>, in company
with twenty <i>Indians</i>. When we came about half
way, we met a messenger from fort <i>Duquesne</i>, with a
belt from <i>Thomas King</i>,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> inviting all the chiefs to
<i>Saccung</i>. We heard at the same time, that Mr. <i>Croghn</i>
and <i>Henry Montour</i> would be there to day. The messenger
was one of those three, that went to our camp;
and it seemed to rejoice all the company; for some of
them were much troubled in their minds, fearing that the
<i>English</i> had kept them, as prisoners, or killed them. In
the evening we arrived at <i>Saccung</i>, on the <i>Beaver</i> creek.
We were well received. The king provided for us.
After a little while we visited Mr. <i>Croghn</i> and his company.</p>

<p>30th.—In the morning the <i>Indians</i> of the town visited
us. About eleven o’clock about forty came together;
when we read the message to them; Mr. <i>Croghn</i>, <i>Henry
Montour</i> and <i>Thomas King</i> being present. They were
all well pleased with the message. In the evening we
came together with the chiefs, and explained the signification
of the belts; which lasted till eleven o’clock at night.</p>

<p><i>December 1st.</i>—After hunting a great while for our
horses, without finding them, we were obliged to give
an <i>Indian</i> three hundred wampum for looking for them.
We bought corn for four hundred and fifty wampum for
our horses. The Indians met together to hear what Mr.
Croghn had to say. <i>Thomas King</i> spoke by a belt, and
invited them to come to the general; upon which they all
resolved to go.</p>

<p>In the evening the captains and counsellors came together,
I and <i>Isaac Still</i> being present; they told us, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
they had formerly agreed not to give any credit to any
message, sent from the English by <i>Indians</i>; thinking, if
the <i>English</i> would have peace with them, they would come
themselves; “So soon, therefore, as you came, it was as
if the weather changed; and a great cloud passed away,
and we could think again on our ancient friendship with
our brethren, the <i>English</i>. We have thought since that
time, more on the <i>English</i> than ever before, although the
<i>French</i> have done all, in their power, to prejudice our
young men against the <i>English</i>. Since you now come
the second time, we think it is God’s work; he pities us,
that we should not all die; and if we should not accept
of the peace offered to us, we think God would forsake
us.”</p>

<p>In discourse, they spoke about preaching, and said,
“They wished many times to hear the word of God; but
they were always afraid the <i>English</i> would take that
opportunity to bring them into bondage.” They invited
me to come and live amongst them; since I had taken
so much pains in bringing a peace about between them
and the <i>English</i>. I told them, “It might be, that when
the peace was firmly established, I would come to proclaim
the peace and love of God to them.”</p>

<p>In the evening arrived a message, with a string of
wampum, to a noted <i>Indian</i>, <i>Ketiuscund</i>, to come to
<i>Wenango</i>, to meet the <i>Unami</i> chief, <i>Quitahicung</i> there;
he said that a <i>French Mohock</i> had killed a <i>Delaware</i>
Indian; and when he was asked why he did it? He said
the <i>French</i> bid him do it.</p>

<p>2d.—Early before we set out, I gave 300 wampums to
the <i>Cayugas</i>, to buy some corn for their horses; they
agreed that I should go before to the general, to acquaint
him of their coming. The <i>Beaver</i> creek being very high,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
it was almost two o’clock in the afternoon, before we came
over the creek; this land seems to be very rich. I, with
my companion, <i>Kekiuscund’s</i> son, came to Log’s-town,
situated on a hill. On the east end is a great piece of
low land, where the old <i>Logs-town</i> used to stand. In the
new <i>Logs-town</i> the <i>French</i> have built about thirty houses
for the <i>Indians</i>. They have a large corn field on the
south side, where the corn stands ungathered. Then
we went further through a large tract of fine land, along
the river side. We came within eight miles of <i>Pittsburg</i>,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
where we lodged on a hill, in the open air. It
was a cold night; and I had forgot my blanket, being
packed upon Mr. Hays’s horse. Between <i>Saccung</i> and
<i>Pittsburg</i>, all the <i>Shawanos</i> towns are empty of people.</p>

<p>3d.—We started early, and came to the river by <i>Pittsburg</i>;
we called that they should come over and fetch
us; but their boats having gone adrift, they made a raft
of black oak pallisadoes, which sunk as soon as it came
into the water. We were very hungry, and staid on that
island, where I had kept council with the <i>Indians</i>, in
the month of August last; for all I had nothing to live on,
I thought myself a great deal better off now, than at that
time, having now liberty to walk upon the island according
to pleasure; and it seemed as if the dark clouds were
dispersed.</p>

<p>While I waited here, I saw the general march off from
<i>Pittsburg</i>; which made me sorry, that I could not have
the pleasure of speaking with him. Towards evening
our whole party arrived: upon which they fired from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
fort with twelve great guns; and our <i>Indians</i> saluted
again three times round with their small arms. By
accident some of the <i>Indians</i> found a raft hid in the
bushes, and Mr. Hays, coming last, went over first with
two Indians. They sent us but a small allowance; so
that it would not serve each round. I tied my belt a
little closer, being very hungry, and nothing to eat.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> It
snowed, and we were obliged to sleep without any shelter.
In the evening they threw light balls from the fort; at
which the <i>Indians</i> started, thinking they would fire at
them; but seeing it was not aimed at them, they rejoiced
to see them fly so high.</p>

<p>4th.—We got up early, and cleared a place from the
snow, cut some fire wood, and hallooed till we were tired.
Towards noon Mr. <i>Hays</i> came with a raft, and the
<i>Indian</i> chiefs went over: he informed me of Colonel
<i>Bouquet’s</i><a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> displeasure with the <i>Indians’</i> answer to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
general, and his desire that they should alter their mind,
in insisting upon the general’s going back; but the <i>Indians</i>
had no inclination to alter their mind. In the afternoon
some provision was sent over, but a small allowance.
When I came over to the fort, the council with the <i>Indians</i>
was almost at an end. I had a discourse with Colonel
<i>Bouquet</i> about the affairs, disposition and resolution of
the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>I drew provision for our journey to fort <i>Ligonier</i>, and
baked bread for our whole company: towards noon the
<i>Indians</i> met together in a conference. First king <i>Beaver</i>
addressed himself to the <i>Mohocks</i>, desiring them to give
their brethren an answer about settling at <i>Pittsburg</i>.
The <i>Mohocks</i> said, “They lived at such a distance, that
they could not defend the <i>English</i> there, if any accident
should befal them; but you, cousins, who live close here,
must think what to do.” Then <i>Beaver</i> said by a
string:</p>

<p>“What this messenger has brought is very agreeable to
us; and as our uncles have made peace with you, the
<i>English</i>, and many other nations, so we likewise join,
and accept of the peace offered to us; and we have already
answered by your messenger, what we have to say to the
general, that he should go back over the mountains; we
have nothing to say to the contrary.”</p>

<p>Neither Mr. <i>Croghn</i> nor <i>Andrew Montour</i> would tell
Colonel <i>Bouquet</i> the <i>Indians’</i> answer. Then Mr. <i>Croghn</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
Colonel <i>Armstrong</i> and Colonel <i>Bouquet</i> went into the
tent by themselves, and I went upon my business. What
they have further agreed I do not know; but when they
had done, I called king <i>Beaver</i>, <i>Shingas</i>, and <i>Kekeuscund</i>,
and said,</p>

<p>“Brethren, if you have any alteration to make, in the
answer to the general, concerning leaving this place, you
will be pleased to let me know.” They said, they would
alter nothing, “We have told them three times to leave
the place and go back; but they insist upon staying here;
if, therefore, they will be destroyed by the <i>French</i> and
the <i>Indians</i>, we cannot help them.”</p>

<p>Colonel <i>Bouquet</i> set out for <i>Loyalhannon</i>: The <i>Indians</i>
got some liquor between ten and eleven o’clock. One
<i>Mohock</i> died; the others fired guns three times over him;
at the last firing one had accidentally loaded his gun with
a double charge: this gun burst to pieces, and broke his
hand clean off; he also got a hard knock on his breast;
and in the morning at nine o’clock he died, and they
buried them in that place, both in one hole.</p>

<p>6th.—It was a cold morning; we swam our horses
over the river, the ice running violently. Mr. <i>Croghn</i>
told me that the <i>Indians</i> had spoke, upon the same
string that I had, to Colonel <i>Bouquet</i>, and altered their
mind; and had agreed and desired that 200 men should
stay at the fort. I refused to make any alteration in
the answer to the general, till I myself did hear it of the
<i>Indians</i>; at which Mr. <i>Croghn</i> grew very angry. I told
him I had already spoke with the <i>Indians</i>; he said, it
was a d—d lie; and desired Mr. <i>Hays</i> to enquire of the
<i>Indians</i>, and take down in writing what they said. Accordingly
he called them, and asked them, if they had
altered their speech, or spoke to Colonel <i>Bouquet</i> on that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
string they gave me. <i>Shingas</i> and the other counsellor
said, they had spoken nothing to Colonel <i>Bouquet</i> on the
string they gave me, but what was agreed between the
Indians at <i>Kushkushking</i>. They said, Mr. <i>Croghn</i> and
<i>Henry Montour</i> had not spoke and acted honestly and
uprightly; they bid us not alter the least, and said, “We
have told them three times to go back; but they will not
go, insisting upon staying here. Now you will let the
governor, general, and all people know, that our desire
is, that they should go back, till the other nations have
joined in the peace, and then they may come and build
a trading house.”</p>

<p>They then repeated what they had said the 5th instant.
Then we took leave of them, and promised to inform the
general, governor, and all other gentle people of their
disposition; and so we set out from <i>Pittsburg</i>, and came
within fifteen miles of the breast-work; where we encamped.
It snowed, and we made a little cabbin of hides.</p>

<p>7th.—Our horses were fainting, having little or no
food. We came that day about twenty miles, to another
breast-work; where the whole army had encamped on a
hill; the water being far to fetch.</p>

<p>8th.—Between <i>Pittsburg</i> and fort <i>Ligonier</i> the country
is hilly, with rich bottoms, well timbered, but scantily
watered. We arrived at fort <i>Ligonier</i> in the afternoon,
about four o’clock; where we found the general very sick;
and therefore could have no opportunity to speak with him.</p>

<p>9th.—We waited to see the general; they told us he
would march the next day, and we should go with him.
Captain <i>Sinclair</i> wrote us a return for provisions for
four days.</p>

<p>10th.—The general was still sick; so that he could not
go on the journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>11th.—We longed very much to go farther; and therefore
spoke to Major <i>Halket</i>,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and desired him to enquire
of the general, if he intended to speak with us, or,
if we might go; as we were in a poor condition, for want
of linen, and other necessaries. He desired us to bring
the <i>Indians’</i> answer, and our journal to the general. Mr.
<i>Hays</i> read his journal to Major <i>Halket</i> and Governor
<i>Glen</i>.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> They took memorandums, and went to the
general.</p>

<p>12th.—They told us we should stay till the general
went.</p>

<p>14th.—The general intended to go; but his horses
could not be found. They thought the <i>Indians</i> had
carried them off. They hunted all day for the horses,
but could not find them. I spoke to Colonel <i>Bouquet</i>
about our allowance being so small, that we could hardly
subsist; and that we were without money; and desired
him to let us have some money, that we might buy necessaries.
Provisions, and every thing is exceeding dear.
One pound of bread cost a shilling; one pound of sugar
four shillings, a quart of rum seven shillings and six
pence, and so in proportion. Colonel Bouquet laid
our matters before the general; who let me call, and
excused himself, that his distemper had hindered him
from speaking with me; and promised to help me in every
thing I should want, and ordered him to give me some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
money. He said farther, that I often should call; and
when he was alone he would speak with me.</p>

<p>16th.—Mr. <i>Hays</i>, being a hunting, was so lucky as to
find the general’s horses, and brought them home; for
which the general was very thankful to him.</p>

<p>17th.—Mr. <i>Hays</i>, being desired by Major <i>Halket</i> to
go and look for the other horses, went, but found none.</p>

<p>18th.—The general told me to hold myself ready, to
go with him down the country.</p>

<p>20th.—After we had been out two days, to hunt
for our horses, in the rain, we went again to day, and were
informed, they had been seen in a lost condition; one
laying on the hill, and the other standing; they had been
hoppled together; but a person told us, he had cut the
hopples. When we came home we found the horses;
they having made home to the fort.</p>

<p>22d.—It was cold and stormy weather.</p>

<p>23d.—I hunted for our horses, and having found them,
we gave them both to the king’s commissary; they not
being able to carry us farther.</p>

<p>The sergeant <i>Henry Osten</i>, being one of the company
that guided us, as above mentioned, and was that same
prisoner, whom the <i>Shawanos</i> intended to burn alive,
came to day to the fort. He was much rejoiced to see us,
and said, “I thank you a thousand times for my deliverance
from the fire; and think it not too much to be at
your service my whole life time.” He gave us intelligence
that the <i>Indians</i> were, as yet, mightily for the <i>English</i>.
His master had offered to set him at liberty, and bring him
to <i>Pittsburg</i> if he would promise him ten gallons of rum;
which he did; and he was brought safe to <i>Pittsburg</i>.
<i>Delaware George</i> is still faithful to the <i>English</i>; and was
very helpful to procure his liberty. <i>Isaac Still</i>, <i>Shingas</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
and <i>Beaver</i> are gone with the message to the nations
living further off. When the <i>French</i> had heard that the
garrison, at <i>Pittsburg</i>, consisted only of 200 men, they
resolved to go down from <i>Venango</i>, and destroy the <i>English</i>
fort. So soon as the <i>Indians</i> at <i>Kushkushking</i>,
heard of their intention, they sent a message to the <i>French</i>,
desiring them to draw back; for they would have no war
in their country. The friendly <i>Indians</i> have sent out
parties with that intention, that if the <i>French</i> went on, in
their march towards the fort, they would catch them, and
bring them to the <i>English</i>. They shewed to <i>Osten</i> the
place, where eight <i>French Indian</i> spies had lain near the
fort. By their marks upon the place they learned that
these eight were gone back, and five more were to come
to the same place again. He told us further, that the
<i>Indians</i> had spoke among themselves, that if the <i>English</i>
would join them, they would go to <i>Venango</i>, and destroy
the <i>French</i> there. We hear that the friendly <i>Indians</i>
intend to hunt round the fort, at <i>Pittsburg</i>, and bring the
garrison fresh meat. And upon this intelligence the
general sent Captain <i>Wedderholz</i><a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> with fifty men, to reinforce
the garrison at <i>Pittsburg</i>.</p>

<p>25th.—The people in the camp prepared for a <i>Christmas</i>
frolick; but I kept <i>Christmas</i> in the woods by myself.</p>

<p>26th.—To day an express came from <i>Pittsburg</i> to inform
the general, that the French had called all the
<i>Indians</i> in their interest together, and intended to come
and destroy them there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>27th.—Towards noon the general set out; which
caused a great joy among the garrison, which had hitherto
lain in tents, but now being a smaller company, could be
more comfortably lodged. It snowed the whole day.
We encamped by a <i>beaver dam</i>, under <i>Laurel Hill</i>.</p>

<p>28th.—We came to <i>Stony Creek</i>, where Mr. <i>Quickfell</i>
is stationed. The general sent Mr. <i>Hays</i>, express, to fort
<i>Bedford</i> (<i>Rays Town</i>) and commanded him to see, if the
place for encampment, under the <i>Allegheny</i> mountain,
was prepared; as also to take care that refreshments
should be at hand, at his coming. It was stormy and
snowed all the day.</p>

<p>29th.—On the road I came up with some waggons;
and found my horses with the company; who had taken
my horse up, and intended to carry the same away. We
encamped on this side, under the <i>Allegheny</i> hill.</p>

<p>30th.—Very early I hunted for my horses, but in vain,
and therefore was obliged to carry my saddle bags, and
other baggage on my back. The burden was heavy,
the roads bad; which made me very tired, and came late
to <i>Bedford</i>; where I took my old lodging with Mr. <i>Frazier</i>.
They received me kindly, and refreshed me according to
their ability.</p>

<p>31st.—This day we rested, and, contrary to expectation,
preparation was made for moving further to-morrow.
Mr. <i>Hays</i>, who has his lodging with the commander
of that place, visited me.</p>

<p>January 1st. 1759.—We set out early. I got my saddle
bags upon a waggon; but my bed and covering I carried
upon my back; and came that day to the crossing of
<i>Juniata</i>: where I had poor lodgings, being obliged to
sleep in the open air, the night being very cold.</p>

<p>2d.—We set out early. I wondered very much that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
the horses, in these slippery roads, came so well with the
waggons over these steep hills. We came to fort <i>Littleton</i>;
where I drew provisions; but could not find any who had
bread, to exchange for flour. I took lodging in a common
house. Mr. <i>Hays</i> arrived late.</p>

<p>3d.—We rose early. I thought to travel the nearest
road to <i>Shippen’s Town</i>, and therefore desired leave of
the general to prosecute my journey to <i>Lancaster</i>, and
wait for his excellency there; but he desired me to follow
in his company. It snowed, freezed, rained, and was
stormy the whole day. All were exceeding glad that the
general arrived safe at fort <i>Loudon</i>. There was no room
in the fort for such a great company; I, therefore, and
some others went two miles further, and got lodgings at a
plantation.</p>

<p>4th.—I and my company took the upper road; which
is three miles nearer to <i>Shippen’s town</i>, where we arrived
this evening. The slippery roads made me, as a traveller,
very tired.</p>

<p>5th.—To day I staid here for the general. Mr. <i>Hays</i>
went ten miles further, to see some of his relations. In
the afternoon <i>Israel Pemberton</i> came from <i>Philadelphia</i> to
wait upon the general.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>6th.—I came to-day ten miles to Mr. <i>Miller’s</i>, where I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
lodged, having no comfortable place in <i>Shippen’s town</i>;
all the houses being crowded with people.</p>

<p>7th.—They made preparation, at Mr. <i>Millers</i>, for
the reception of the general; but he, being so well to-day,
resolved to go as far as <i>Carlisle</i>. I could scarce find any
lodging there. <i>Henry Montour</i> was so kind as to take
me in his room.</p>

<p>8th.—I begged the general for leave to go to <i>Lancaster</i>,
having some business, which he at last granted. I went
to captain Sinclair for a horse, who ordered me to go to
the chief justice of the town; who ought to procure one
for me, in the province service. According to this order
I went; but the justice told me, that he did not know how
to get any horse; if I would go and look for one, he should
be glad if I found any. But having no mind to run from
one to another, I resolved to walk, as I had done before:
and so travelled along, and came about ten miles that day
to a tavern keeper’s, named <i>Chesnut</i>.</p>

<p>9th.—To-day I crossed the <i>Susquahanna</i> over the ice,
and came within thirteen miles of <i>Lancaster</i>. It was
slippery and heavy travelling.</p>

<p>10th.—It rained all the day. I arrived at three o’clock
in the afternoon, in <i>Lancaster</i>; and was quite refreshed, to
have the favour to see my brethren.</p>

people from Georgia. Count Zinzendorf organized the congregation at this
place, and named the settlement (1742). For the first twenty years a community
system prevailed among the inhabitants, called the “Economy.”
Portions of the buildings erected under that régime are still standing. See
“Moravians and their Festival,” in <i>Outlook</i>, August 1, 1903. In 1752, the
brethren built a large stone house for the accommodation of Indian visitors,
and those who escaped the massacre of 1755 were domiciled there when Post
passed through.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_187" href="#FNanchor_187" class="label">[10]</a> After Braddock’s defeat, the ravaging of the frontiers both west and north
of the settled portions of Pennsylvania became so serious that the colonial
government appointed a commission, headed by Franklin, to take means to
protect the settlers, and defend the territory. Franklin proceeded into Northumberland
County, and made arrangements to fortify the point on the Lehigh
where Weisport, Carbon County, now stands. But before the stockade was
completed a body of Indians fell upon and seriously defeated a party of militia
from the neighboring Irish settlements, led by Captain Hayes (January, 1756).
The works were pushed rapidly after this setback, and the fort was named in
honor of William Allen, chief-justice of the province. This post was garrisoned
until after Pontiac’s War, and probably throughout the Revolution. See
Franklin’s <i>Writings</i> (New York, 1887), ii, pp. 449-454.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_188" href="#FNanchor_188" class="label">[11]</a> Teedyuscung, one of the most famous of Delaware chiefs, was born in
Trenton about 1705. When nearly fifty years old, he was chosen chief of the
Susquehanna Delawares, and being shrewd and cunning played a game of
diplomacy between the Iroquois, the Ohio Indians, and the authorities of
Pennsylvania, by which he managed largely to enhance his own importance,
and to free the Delawares from their submission to the Six Nations. His
headquarters were in the Wyoming Valley, whence he descended to the Moravian
settlements, and even to Easton and Philadelphia, to secure supplies from the
Pennsylvania authorities. In 1756 a truce was patched up with this chief at
Easton, after he had bitterly complained of the “Walking Purchase” of 1737,
and the white settlements on the Juniata. His loyalty to the English was
doubtful and wavering, and his opposition to Post’s journey was probably due
to fears that his own importance as a medium between the Ohio Indians and
the English would be diminished by the former’s success. His cabin at Wyoming
having treacherously been set on fire, during one of his drunken sleeps,
Teedyuscung was burned to death in 1763. The Iroquois, who were the guilty
party, threw the obloquy upon the Connecticut settlement, whereupon Teedyuscung’s
followers murdered all the band.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_189" href="#FNanchor_189" class="label">[12]</a> Wyoming Valley was the bone of contention between the Connecticut
and Pennsylvania colonies, each claiming that it was within their charter
limits. The Connecticut agents succeeded in securing an Indian title at the
Albany conference (1754); but their first settlement being effaced by an Indian
massacre (see preceding note), their next body of emigrants did not proceed
thither until 1769. Meanwhile, on the strength of the Indian purchase at
Fort Stanwix (1768) the Pennsylvanians had occupied the valley; and a border
warfare began, which lasted until the Revolution. The massacre of 1778, by
the Tories and British Indians, is a matter of general history.</p>

<p>The Indians of the valley were of many tribes—Oneidas, Delawares,
Shawnees, Munseys, Nanticokes, etc. The Moravian Christian Indians
settled at Wyoming in 1752. After the murder of Teedyuscung they fled, but
returned to found the town of Wyalusing (1765), where the missionary Zeisberger
lived with them until their removal, three years later to the Ohio.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

crossed the headwaters of the Schuylkill, and traversed Northumberland County
to Fort Augusta. On the massacres in that region see Rupp, <i>History of Northumberland</i>,
etc., (Lancaster, 1847), pp. 100-116. Fort Augusta, at the forks
of the Susquehanna, was built in 1756, at the request of the Indians settled
there under the chieftainship of Shickalamy. It was not a mere stockade and
blockhouse, but a regular fortification, provided with cannon, and was commanded
at first by Colonel Clapham, succeeded by Colonel James Burd. This
stronghold was garrisoned until after the Revolutionary War; but before that
time settlement had begun to spring up about the fort, and the town of Sunbury
was laid out in 1772.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Susquehanna, through a region which had earlier been thickly sprinkled with
Indian towns. The Moravian missionaries had been here as early as 1742, and
had been hospitably received by Madame Montour, whose town was at the
mouth of Loyalsock Creek, opposite the present village of Montoursville. This
was probably Post’s “Wekeponall,” as the path to Wyoming led northeast from
this place. Queenashawakee (Quenslehague) Creek is in Lycoming County,

that point the trail led up the creek to a point above Milesburg, Center County,
then turned almost due west across Center and Clearfield counties to Clearfield
(Shinglimuhee). This was the “Chinklacamoos path,” north of the
Kittanning trail followed by Weiser in 1748. The word “Chinklacamoos”
is said to signify “it almost joins,” in allusion to a horseshoe bend at this
place. See Meginness, <i>Otzinachson: A History of the West Branch Valley</i>

<p><a id="Footnote_200" href="#FNanchor_200" class="label">[23]</a> The officer commanding Venango at this time was Jean Baptiste Boucher
Sieur de Niverville, a noted border ranger and Indian raider. Born in Montreal
in 1716, he early acquired an ascendency over the Abenaki Indians, which
was utilized in leading their parties against the English settlements of New
England. In King George’s War, bands under his command ravaged New
Hampshire and Vermont, and penetrated as far as Fort Massachusetts in the
Berkshire Hills (1748). During the French and Indian War, he was similarly
employed, and after Braddock’s defeat, conducted a winter campaign of thirty-three
days, in the direction of Fort Cumberland on the Potomac, bringing off
numerous English captives. At Lake George in 1757, he led the Abenaki
auxiliaries, and was present at the massacre of Fort William Henry. The last
that is known of his military exploits is during the siege of Quebec, when he
defended dangerous outposts with the aid of savage allies.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Nations from the Sun Rise to these beyond the Lakes, as far as the Sun setts,
have heard what has passed between you and me, and are pleased with it,”
and urged him to continue the work of peace. Teedyuscung was evidently

<p><a id="Footnote_222" href="#FNanchor_222" class="label">[45]</a> Kuckquetackton (Koquethagechton) was the Indian name of the famous
Delaware chief Captain White Eyes. About 1776, he succeeded Netawatwes,
of whom he had been chief counsellor, as head of the nation Heckewelder first
met him at this same town, where Post encountered him in 1772, and says
that he strove to keep the neutrality during both Lord Dunmore’s War and the
Revolution. Finding that impossible, he joined the American cause (1778), and
brought an Indian contingent to the aid of General McIntosh at Fort
Laurens; dying, however, before the attack was made on the Sandusky towns.
He was always a firm friend of the Moravians, and though of small stature
was one of the best and bravest of Delaware chiefs.</p>

<p>There were two chiefs known by the name of Killbuck, the younger of
whom was the more famous. His Indian name was Gelelemend, and he was a
grandson of the great chief Netawatwes. Born near Lehigh Water Gap in the
decade 1730-40, he removed to the Allegheny with the Delawares, and later
to the Muskingum, where was a village called Killbuck’s Town. Like White
Eyes, he was a firm friend of peace and of the whites, and his life was imperilled
because of this advocacy. He joined the Moravians, and was baptized as
William Henry, about 1788. Later he removed to Pittsburg to secure protection
from his enemies, but died at Goshen in 1811. A lineal descendant of
Killbuck is at present a Moravian missionary in Alaska.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

in the armies of Sardinia and Holland, was engaged to enter the regiment of

in command in South Carolina; but early in 1758 was summoned north to aid
Forbes in his march through Pennsylvania. Bouquet commanded the advance,
and prepared the road, ordered the stations for reserve supplies, and by careful
management contributed much to the success of the campaign. Upon Forbes’s
retiring, Bouquet was left in command at Fort Pitt, where he remained fulfilling
the arduous and exacting duties of his frontier service until late in 1762,
when he was relieved by Captain Ecuyer, and returned to Philadelphia. On
the news of the siege of Fort Pitt (1763), Bouquet organized a relief expedition,
which inflicted a severe defeat upon the Indians at Bushy Run. The following
year, the Indian country was invaded, Bouquet’s expedition to the Muskingum
proving a complete success. Relieved from his Western command, he
was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general and placed in command of all
the troops in the southern British colonies of America. He died at Pensacola,
February, 1766, at the early age of forty-seven. He was not only a soldier of
ability and vigor, but a man of most attractive and charming character, beloved
by superiors and subordinates. The collection of his letters in the British
Museum is a chief source for the history of the West during this period. See

</div>

<p>The journal of Captain Thomas Morris is notable from
two points of view. First, because of its rarity—the
volume in which it is found, <i>Miscellanies in Prose and
Verse</i> (London, printed for James Ridgway, 1791),
being a treasure much prized by the collector of valuable
Americana. In the second place, the journal is of importance
to historical students because of the light it
throws upon conditions in the West at this critical moment
(1766), and the proof it furnishes that Pontiac’s influence
was still paramount among the Western Indians, that
Bradstreet had been completely duped, and that native
hostility to British sovereignty over the Western tribes
was deep-seated, and would take many years wholly to
uproot.</p>

<p>Incidentally, also, the journal possesses considerable
dramatic interest. Dealing with a single episode, told
in the first person by the chief participant, and he a
person of literary tastes, the thrilling incidents—repeated
escapes from torture and death, the flight through
the woods, and the final refuge at Detroit—all depicted
graphically, yet simply, hold one’s attention unflagging
to the end. The side touches are in keeping with the
principal incidents: the contrast between the author’s
situation and his calm enjoyment of Shakespeare’s tragedy,
so curiously preserved for him from the loot of some
English officer’s baggage; the appearance of the white
charger that had borne its master Braddock to sudden
death in the Monongahela Valley nine years before; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
gratitude and fidelity of the Canadian Godefroy, evinced
to so good a purpose; the pomp and pride of the red-coated
brave who wore on his back his reward for services
to Sir William Johnson; the honor of Pontiac and the
Miami chief, who protected with difficulty the sacred
person of an ambassador; the roguery of the Loretto
Indian, who deserted his chief and so speedily suffered
therefor—all these circumstances heighten and prolong
the reader’s interest, and add vividness to the narrative.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the author’s life is but slight. He
came of a race of soldiers, his father and grandfather before
him having served as captains of the same regiment in which
he was an officer. His early education was considerable;
and fifteen months had been spent in Paris familiarizing
himself with the language and literature of its people.
His tastes were always those of a scholar and a lover of
literature; he being of that class of British soldiers of
which Wolfe was so conspicuous an example, whose
recreations took the line of literary appreciation and performance.
Morris came to America in 1758, as a lieutenant
in the 17th regiment of infantry, in which he had
been commissioned three years previous. Although this
was Forbes’s command, Morris saw service at Louisburg
in 1758, and was with Amherst in the campaign around
Lake Champlain in the following year. In 1761, he was
promoted to a captaincy and assigned to the garrison of
Fort Hendrick, at Canajoharie in the Mohawk Valley—the
home of the famous Mohawk chiefs, Hendricks and
Brant. It was doubtless there that he acquired that
knowledge of the Mohawk temperament which he exhibits
in the opening pages of his journal. While stationed at
this lonely outpost he addressed his friend “Dicky”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
Montgomery in a parody of one of Horace’s odes, which
possesses more historical interest than literary merit.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It is evident from his dedication of certain odes to “ceux
des Français, qui ont connu l’auteur au siége de la
Martinique,” that Morris accompanied General Monckton
upon that expedition in 1762.</p>

<p>After his adventures along the Maumee, related in the
present journal, he remained at Detroit for some time,
and returned to England with his regiment in 1767. At
this time occurred his meeting with the soldier whom
he had previously encountered as an Indian prisoner,
under circumstances of great danger and distress, near
the treacherously-destroyed Fort Miami.</p>

<p>What we know of Morris’s later life is comprised in
his “Preamble” to the volume containing this journal.
Having retired from the army in 1775, he lost his property
by means of speculative ventures. For the sake of
his children, he appealed to the king for a pension, on the
ground of past services, especially those detailed in the
Maumee journal. A copy of the journal was annexed
to the petition, but the latter failed of effect. The narrative
here reprinted was laid aside until encouragement
from a “respectable gentleman of my acquaintance, a
man of letters in whose judgment I place implicit faith”
determined him to print some of his literary efforts and
to include the journal to “complete the volume.” He
expresses the hope that the recital of his adventures
“might possibly, some time or other, procure a friend or
protector to one of my children.” “This is a plain and
simple tale,” he concludes, “accounting for my presumption
in offering to the public an old story relating
to one whose wish used to be, to lie concealed in domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
life; a wish, in which he has been amply gratified by the
very obliging silence of some of his nearest connexions.”</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that the journal, unlike most
of the others we publish in this volume, was dressed
up for publication, and purposely given a dramatic
turn. The official report of the expedition, as sent to
Bradstreet, together with letters from Morris to his
superior, are in the British Public Record Office, still
unpublished.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The small volume of <i>Miscellanies</i>, from which we
extract the journal, contains in addition thereto an essay
on dramatic art, translations of two of Juvenal’s satires,
and five odes which are accompanied by transliterations
into French prose. Morris had already published two
collections of songs—in 1786, and in 1790. In 1792,
appeared his <i>Life of Reverend David Williams</i>; and four
years later a versified tale, <i>Quashy, or the Coal Black
Maid</i>, which has been described as “a negroe love story
which bears reference to the slave-trade, and is here but
indifferently told.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> With the publication in 1802, of
<i>Songs, Political and Convivial</i>, Captain Thomas Morris
passes from public view.</p>

<p>The character of the man throws the incidents of this
hazardous journey into still stronger relief. Here is no
frontiersman like Weiser and Croghan, familiar with the
hardships of the wilderness; no missionary, like Post,
seeking rewards not measured by earthly laurels and
success; not even a bluff, practical soldier like Bradstreet,
who dispatched him on his venturesome mission.
Morris was a man of the great world, a fashionable
dilettante, dabbling in literature and the dramatic art.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
Parkman comments on his round English face—as
shown in the portrait which appears on the frontispiece
to his <i>Miscellanies</i>, and which we republish as frontispiece
to the present volume—and the lack of resolution
and courage therein expressed. Yet upon his
memorable embassy he displayed no want of either.
Probably it was his familiarity with the French language
that led to his being chosen for the task; he entered
upon it with commendable zeal, and attempted to carry
out his orders at every risk.</p>

<p>Doubtless the adventure appealed to that latent fondness
for experiences, that men of the literary temperament
frequently possess. In his essay on dramatic art
he says, “If the world ever afforded me a pleasure
equal to that of reading Shakespear at the foot of a
water-fall in an American desert, it was Du Menil’s performance
of tragedy.” Morris evinced a steadiness of
courage, endurance, and hardihood, fortitude under disaster,
and an unflinching determination to do his duty,
as well as a power of attaching men to his service, that
would do credit to any man. For a victim of Indian
cruelties, his magnanimity was a still rarer quality. He
bore no grudge against his savage tormentors, speaking
of them as “an innocent, much-abused, and once happy
people.” His appreciation of the qualities of the French
Canadians, and his remarks upon their conduct of Indian
affairs show keen observation, astuteness, and a judgment
free from prejudice. As an author, wit, man of
affairs, courageous soldier, magnanimous foe, we may
apply to him in earnest the epithet levied in jest by the
reviewer of his first volume of songs—the “inimitable
Captain Morris.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="JOURNAL_MORRIS">JOURNAL OF CAPTAIN THOMAS MORRIS OF HIS MAJESTY’S XVII REGIMENT OF
INFANTRY</h3>

</div>

<p>General Bradstreet, who commanded an army sent
against those Indian nations who had cut off several
English garrisons, of which we had taken possession after
the surrender of Canada, having too hastily determined to
send an officer to take possession also of the Illinois
country in his Britannic Majesty’s name, sent his Aid de
Camp to sound me on the occasion. His Aid de Camp
desired me to recommend some officer with qualities he
described. I named every one that I could recollect; but
he always answered me shortly: “No, no; he won’t do.”
I then began to suspect that he might have a design on
myself. Accordingly I said: “If I thought my services
would be acceptable”—He interrupted me: “That is
what is wanted.” I replied: “Why did you not say so
at first?” He said, with an oath: “It is not a thing to
be asked of any man.” I answered: “If the General
thinks me the properest person, I am ready.” I was
immediately conducted to the General; and while I was
at dinner with him, he said, in his frank manner: “Morris,
I have a French fellow here, my prisoner, who expects
to be hanged for treason; he speaks all the Indian languages,
and if you think he can be of use to you, I’ll
send for him, pardon him, and send him with you.”
I answered: “I am glad you have thought of it, Sir;
I wish you would.” The prisoner, whose name was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Godefroi,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was accordingly sent for; and, as soon as he entered
the tent, he turned pale, and fell on his knees, begging
for mercy. The General telling him that it was in his
power to hang him, concluded with saying: “I give thee
thy life; take care of this gentleman.” The man expressed
a grateful sense of the mercy shewn him, and protested
that he would be faithful: and indeed his behaviour
afterwards proved that he was sincere in his promise.
As General Bradstreet had pardoned him on my account,
he considered me as his deliverer. Little minds hate
obligations; and thence the transition is easy to the hatred
of their benefactor: this man’s soul was of another make,
and, though in a low station, a noble pride urged him to
throw a heavier weight of obligation on him to whom he
thought he was indebted for his liberty, if not his life;
and I had the singular satisfaction of owing those blessings
to one who fancied he owed the same to me.</p>

<p>While I was preparing to set out, the boats being almost
loaden with our provisions and necessaries, the Aid de
Camp told me, that if the Indian deputies, who were
expected to arrive at the camp that evening, did not come,
the Uttawaw [Ottawa] village,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where I was to lie that
night, would be attacked at three o’clock in the morning;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
“but that,” added he, “will make no difference in your
affairs.” I was astonished that the General could think
so: but I made no reply to him, and we talked of other
matters. However, as I was stepping into my boat, some
canoes appeared, and I came on shore again, and found
they were the Indian deputies who were expected. This
I thought a very happy incident for me; and having
received proper powers and instructions I set out in
good spirits from Cedar Point,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in Lake Erie, on the 26th
of August, 1764, about four o’clock in the afternoon, at
the same time that the army proceeded for Detroit. My
escort consisted of Godefroi, and another Canadian, two
servants, twelve Indians, our allies, and five Mohawks,
with a boat in which were our provisions, who were to
attend us to the swifts of the Miamis river, about ten
leagues distant, and then return to the army. I had with
me likewise Warsong, the great Chippawaw chief, and
Attawang, an Uttawaw chief, with some other Indians
of their nations, who had come the same day to our camp
with proposals of peace. We lay that night at the mouth
of the Miamis river.</p>

<p>I was greatly delighted on observing the difference of
temper betwixt these Indian strangers and those of my
old acquaintance of the five nations. Godefroi was employed
in interpreting to me all their pleasantries; and I
thought them the most agreeable ralliers I had ever met
with. As all men love those who resemble themselves,
the sprightly manners of the French cannot fail to recommend
them to these savages, as our grave deportment is
an advantage to us among our Indian neighbors; for it
is certain that a reserved Englishman differs not more
from a lively Frenchman than does a stern Mohawk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
from a laughing Chippawaw. The next day (27th) we
arrived at the Swifts,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> six leagues from the mouth of the
river, and the Uttawaw chief sent to his village for
horses. Soon after a party of young Indians came to us
on horseback, and the two Canadians and myself having
mounted, we proceeded, together with the twelve Indians
my escort, who were on foot, and marched in the front,
the chief carrying English colours, towards the village,
which was two leagues and a half distant. On our approaching
it, I was astonished to see a great number of
white flags flying; and, passing by the encampment of the
Miamis, while I was admiring the regularity and contrivance
of it, I heard a yell, and found myself surrounded
by Pondiac’s army, consisting of six hundred savages,
with tommahawks in their hands, who beat my horse, and
endeavoured to separate me from my Indians, at the
head of whom I had placed myself on our discovering the
village. By their malicious smiles, it was easy for me
to guess their intention of putting me to death. They
led me up to a person, who stood advanced before two
slaves (prisoners of the Panis nation, taken in war and
kept in slavery<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>) who had arms, himself holding a fusee
with the butt on the ground. By his dress, and the air
he assumed, he appeared to be a French officer: I afterwards
found that he was a native of old France, had been
long in the regular troops as a drummer, and that his
war-name was St. Vincent. This fine dressed half
French, half Indian figure desired me to dismount; a
bear-skin was spread on the ground, and St. Vincent and
I sat upon it, the whole Indian army, circle within circle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
standing round us. Godefroi sat at a little distance from
us; and presently came Pondiac, and squatted himself,
after his fashion, opposite to me. This Indian has a
more extensive power than ever was known among that
people; for every chief used to command his own tribe:
but eighteen nations, by French intrigue, had been
brought to unite, and chuse this man for their commander,
after the English had conquered Canada; having been
taught to believe that, aided by France, they might make
a vigorous push and drive us out of North America.
Pondiac asked me in his language, which Godefroi interpreted,
“whether I was come to tell lies, like the rest of
my countrymen.” He said, “That Ononteeo (the
French king) was not crushed as the English had reported,
but had got upon his legs again,” and presented me a
letter from New Orleans, directed to him, written in
French, full of the most improbable falsehoods, though
beginning with a truth. The writer mentioned the
repulse of the English troops in the Mississippi, who
were going to take possession of Fort Chartres,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> blamed
the Natchez nation for their ill conduct in that affair,
made our loss in that attack to be very considerable, and
concluded with assuring him, that a French army was
landed in Louisiana, and that his father (the French
king) would drive the English out of the country. I
began to reason with him; but St. Vincent hurried me
away to his cabin; where, when he talked to me of the
French army, I asked him if he thought me fool enough
to give credit to that account; and told him that none but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
the simple Indians could be so credulous. Attawang,
the Uttawaw chief, came to seek me, and carried me to
his cabin. The next day (28th) I went to the grand
council, and addressed the chiefs. When I mentioned
that their father, the king of France, had ceded those
countries to their brother the king of England, (for so
the two kings are called by the Indians) the great Miamis
chief started up and spoke very loud, in his singular
language, and laughed. Godefroi whispered me, that
it was very lucky that he received my intelligence with
contempt and not anger, and desired me to say no more,
but sit down, and let my chief speak; accordingly I sat
down, and he produced his belts, and spoke. I have
called the Miamis tongue a singular language; because
it has no affinity in its sound with any other Indian language
which I have heard. It is much wondered whence
this nation came; who differ as much from all the other
nations in their superstitious practices, as in their speech,
and manner of encamping.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> As they left the Uttawaw
villages before me on their way home, we traced their
encampments, where we saw their offerings of tobacco,
made by every individual each morning, ranged in the
nicest order, on long slips of bark both on the shore, and
on rocks in the river. They carry their God in a bag,
which is hung in the front of their encampment, and is
visited by none but the priest; if any other person presumes
to advance between the front of the encampment
and that spirit in the bag, he is put to death: and I was
told that a drunken French soldier, who had done so,
was with great difficulty saved. When the council was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
over, St. Vincent changed his note, and told me that if
I could ensure to him his pardon, he would go to Detroit.
I answered him, “that it was not in my power to promise
it.” However, as I found that I could not well do without
him, I contrived to make him my friend. Pondiac
said to my chief: “If you have made peace with the
English, we have no business to make war on them.
The war-belts came from you.” He afterwards said
to Godefroi: “I will lead the nations to war no more;
let ’em be at peace, if they chuse it: but I myself will never
be a friend to the English. I shall now become a wanderer
in the woods; and if they come to seek me there,
while I have an arrow left, I will shoot at them.” This I
imagined he said in despair, and gave it as my opinion,
that he might easily be won to our interest; and it afterwards
proved so. He made a speech to the chiefs, who
wanted to put me to death, which does him honour;
and shews that he was acquainted with the law of nations:
“We must not,” said he, “kill ambassadors: do we not
send them to the Flat-heads, our greatest enemies,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
they to us? Yet these are always treated with hospitality.”
The following day (29th) the Mohawk, who commanded
the Indians in the provision-boat, stole away, without
taking my letter to General Bradstreet, as he had been
ordered, having, the night before, robbed us of almost
every thing, and sold my rum (two barrels) to the Uttawaws.
The greater part of the warriors got drunk; and
a young Indian drew his knife, and made a stroke at me;
but Godefroi seized his arm, threw him down, and took
the knife from him. He certainly saved my life, for I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
was fitting, and could not have avoided the blow though
I saw it coming. I was now concealed under my matress,
as all the young Indians were determined to murder me,
was afterwards obliged to put on Indian shoes and cover
myself with a blanket to look like a savage, and escape by
fording the river into a field of Indian corn with St. Vincent,
Godefroi, and the other Canadian. Pondiac
asked Godefroi, who returned to the village to see what
was going on, “what he had done with the English man.”
And being told, he said, “you have done well.” Attawang
came to see me, and made his two sons guard me.
Two Kickapoo chiefs came to me, and spoke kindly,
telling me that they had not been at war with the English
for seven years. Two Miamis came likewise, and told
me that I need not be afraid to go to their village. A
Huron woman however abused me because the English
had killed her son. Late at night I returned to Attawang’s
cabin, where I found my servant concealed under
a blanket, the Indians having attempted to murder him;
but they had been prevented by St. Vincent. There
was an alarm in the night, a drunken Indian having
been seen at the skirt of the wood. One of the Delaware
nation, who happened to be with Pondiac’s army, passing
by the cabin where I lay, called out in broken English:
“D—d son of a b—ch.” All this while I saw none of
my own Indians: I believe their situation was almost
as perilous as my own. The following day (30th) the
Miamis and Kickapoos set out on their return home, as
provisions were growing scarce. An Indian called the
little chief, told Godefroi that he would send his son with
me, and made me a present of a volume of Shakespear’s
plays; a singular gift from a savage. He however begged
a little gunpowder in return, a commodity to him much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
more precious than diamonds. The next day (31st) I
gave Attawang, who was going to Detroit, a letter for
General Bradstreet,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and to one of my servants whom I
sent along with this chief, I gave another for his Aid de
Camp. And now, having purchased three horses and
hired two canoes to carry our little baggage, I set out
once more, having obtained Pondiac’s consent, for the
Illinois country, with my twelve Indians, the two Canadians,
St. Vincent’s two slaves, and the little chief’s son
and nephew. There was scarcely any water in the channel
of the river, owing to the great drought, so that the
canoes could hardly be dragged along empty in some
places. We passed by the island where is Pondiac’s
village, and arrived at a little village consisting of only
two pretty large cabins, and three small ones, and here
we encamped: that is, we lay on the ground; and as a
distinguished personage, I was honoured by having a few
small branches under me, and a sort of basket-work
made by bending boughs with their ends fixed in the
earth, for me to thrust my head under to avoid the musketoes
or large gnats with which that country is infested.
The day following (August 1st)<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> arrived St. Vincent and
Pondiac. The latter gave the former the great belt,
forty years old, on which were described two hundred
and ten villages. St. Vincent joined us, and we set forward,
and arrived at another village of the Uttawaws,
the last of their villages we had to pass. One of the
chiefs of this village gave me his hand, and led us into the
cabin for strangers, where was Katapelleecy, a chief of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
very great note, who gave his hand to all my fellow-travellers,
but not to me. This man was a famous
dreamer, and told St. Vincent that he had talked with the
great spirit the preceding night; and had he happened to
dream any thing to my disadvantage the night I lay
there, it had been over with me.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The Indian who gave
me his hand, went into the upper range of beds, and came
down dressed in a laced scarlet coat with blue cuffs, and
a laced hat. I wondered more at the colour of the cloaths
than at the finery; and was told that it was a present from
the English, and that this Indian had conducted Sir
William Johnson to Detroit.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The next morning (2d)
he told me the English were liars; that if I spoke falsehoods
he should know it, and asked why the General
desired to see the Indians at Detroit, and if he would
cloathe them. I assured him that the General sought
their friendship; and gave him, at his own request, a
letter of recommendation to him. We then continued our
route towards the Miamis country, putting our baggage
into the canoes, but the greater part of us went by land,
as the water was so shallow, that those who worked the
canoes were frequently obliged to wade and drag them
along. We met an Indian and his wife in a canoe returning
from hunting; and bought plenty of venison ready
dressed, some turkeys, and a great deal of dried fish for a
small quantity of powder and shot. The following day
(3d) we were over-taken by Pondiac’s nephew and two
other young Uttawaws, who, with the Chippawaws before-mentioned,
made the party twenty-four. We met an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
Indian who, as we afterwards found, had been despatched
to Pondiac with belts from the Shawanese and Delawares;
but he would not stop to talk to us. This day I saw made
the most extraordinary meal to which I ever was or ever
can be witness. Till these last named Indians joined us
we had killed nothing but a very large wild cat, called a
pichou,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which indeed was very good eating: but this
day we eat two deer, some wild turkeys, wild geese, and
wild ducks, besides a great quantity of Indian corn. Of
the wild ducks and Indian corn we made broth; the
Indians made spoons of the bark of a tree in a few minutes,
and, for the first time, I eat of boiled wild duck. When
we marched on after dinner, I could perceive no fragments
left. What an Indian can eat is scarcely credible
to those who have not seen it. Indeed the Frenchmen,
who had been used to savage life, expressed their astonishment
at the quantity which had been devoured. The
next day (4th) we found plenty of game, having sufficient
time to hunt for it, as the canoes were for the greatest
part of the day dragged along, there not being water
sufficient to float them. The day after (5th) we met an
Indian on a handsome white horse, which had been
General Braddock’s, and had been taken ten years before
when that General was killed on his march to Fort du
Quesne, afterwards called Fort Pitt, on the Ohio. The
following day (6th) we arrived at a rocky shoal, where the
water was not more than two or three inches deep, and
found a great number of young Indians spearing fish
with sticks burnt at the end and sharpened; an art at
which they are very dexterous; for the chief, who steered
my canoe with a setting-pole (no oars being used the
whole way), whenever he saw a fish, used to strike it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
through with his pole, though the end had been blunted
and made as flat and broad as a shilling, pin it to the
ground, then lift it out of the water, and shake it into the
boat. I never saw him miss a fish which he took aim at.
The day after, on the seventh of September, in the morning
we got into easy water, and arrived at the meadow
near the Miamis fort, pretty early in the day. We were
met at the bottom of the meadow by almost the whole
village, who had brought spears and tommahawks, in
order to despatch me; even the little children had bows
and arrows to shoot at the Englishman who was come
among them; but I had the good fortune to stay in the
canoe, reading the tragedy of Anthony and Cleopatra,
in the volume of Shakespear which the little chief had
given me, when the rest went on shore, though perfectly
ignorant of their intention, I pushed the canoe over to
the other side of the river, where I saw a man cutting
wood. I was surprised to hear him speak English. On
questioning him I found he was a prisoner, had been one
of Lieutenant Holmes’s garrison at the Miamis Fort,
which officer the Indians had murdered, a young squaw
whom he kept having enticed him out of the garrison
under a pretext of her mother’s wanting to be bled.
They cut off his head, brought it to the fort, and threw
it into the corporal’s bed,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and afterwards killed all the
garrison except five or six whom they reserved as victims
to be sacrificed when they should lose a man in their wars
with the English. They had all been killed except this
one man whom an old squaw had adopted as her son.
Some years afterwards, when I lay on board a transport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
in the harbour of New York, in order to return to Europe,
Sir Henry Moore, then governor of that province,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> came
to bid me adieu, and was rowed on board by this very
man among others. The man immediately recollected
me; and we felt, on seeing each other, what those only
can feel who have been in the like situations. On our
arrival at the fort, the chiefs assembled, and passed me
by, when they presented the pipe of friendship; on which
I looked at Godefroi, and said: “Mauvais augure pour
moi.” A bad omen for me. Nor was I mistaken; for
they led my Indians to the village, on the other side of the
water, and told me to stay in the fort with the French
inhabitants; though care had been taken to forbid them
to receive me into their houses, and some strings of
wampum, on which the French had spoken to spare my
life, had been refused. We wondered at this treatment,
as we expected that I should be civilly received; but soon
learned that this change of temper was owing to the
Shawanese and Delawares, a deputation of fifteen of
them having come there with fourteen belts and six
strings of wampum; who, in the name of their nations,
and of the Senecas, declared they would perish to a man
before they would make peace with the English: seven
of them had returned to their villages; five were gone to
Wyaut [Ouiatonon]; and three had set out the morning I
had arrived for St. Joseph;<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> (a fortunate circumstance
for me, for they had determined to kill me). The Shawanese
and Delawares begged of the Miamis either to put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
us to death (the Indians and myself) or to tie us and send
us prisoners to their villages, or at least to make us return.
They loaded the English with the heaviest reproaches;
and added, that while the sun shone they would be at
enmity with us. The Kiccapoos, Mascoutins, and
Wiatanons, who happened to be at the Miamis village
declared, that they would dispatch me at their villages,
if the Miamis should let me pass. The Shawanese
and Delawares concluded their speeches with saying:
“This is the last belt we shall send you, till we send the
hatchet; which will be about the end of next month
(October).” Doubtless their design was to amuse
General Bradstreet with fair language, to cut off his
army at Sandusky, when least expected, and then to
send the hatchet to the nations: a plan well laid; but of
which it was my good fortune to prevent them from
attempting the execution. To return to myself: I remained
in the fort, and two Indian warriors (one of
whom was called Visenlair) with tommahawks in their
hands, seized me, one by each arm; on which I turned
to Godefroi, the only person who had not left me, and
cried out to him, seeing him stand motionless and pale:
“Eh bien! Vous m’abandonnez donc?” Well then!
You give me up? He answered: “Non, mon capitaine,
je ne vous abandonnerai jamais,” No, my captain, I
will never give you up; and followed the Indians, who
pulled me along to the water-side, where I imagined they
intended to put me into a canoe; but they dragged me
into the water. I concluded their whim was to drown
me, and then scalp me; but I soon found my mistake, the
river being fordable. They led me on till we came near
their village; and there they stopped and stripped me.
They could not get off my shirt, which was held by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
wrist bands, after they had pulled it over my head; and in
rage and despair I tore it off myself. They then bound
my arms with my sash, and drove me before them to a
cabin, where was a bench, on which they made me sit.
The whole village was now in an uproar. Godefroi prevailed
with St. Vincent, who had followed us to the water-side,
but had turned back, to come along with him; and
encouraged Pondiac’s nephew and the little chief’s son
to take my part. St. Vincent brought the great belt, and
Pondiac’s nephew spoke. Nanamis, an Indian, bid
Godefroi take courage, and not quit me. Godefroi told
le Cygne, a Miamis chief, that his children were at
Detroit; and that, if they killed me, he could not tell
what might befal them. He spoke likewise to le Cygne’s
son, who whispered his father, and the father came and
unbound my arms, and gave me his pipe to smoke.
Visenlair, upon my speaking, got up and tied me by the
neck to a post. And now every one was preparing to
act his part in torturing me. The usual modes of torturing
prisoners are applying hot stones to the soles of
the feet, running hot needles into the eyes, which latter
cruelty is generally performed by the women, and shooting
arrows and running and pulling them out of the sufferer in
order to shoot them again and again: this is generally
done by the children. The torture is often continued
two or three days, if they can contrive to keep the prisoner
alive so long. These modes of torture I should not have
mentioned, if the gentleman who advised me to publish
my journal, had not thought it necessary. It may easily
be conceived what I must have felt at the thought of
such horrors which I was to endure. I recollect perfectly
what my apprehensions were. I had not the
smallest hope of life; and I remember that I conceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
myself as it were going to plunge into a gulf, vast, immeasurable;
and that, in a few moments after, the thought
of torture occasioned a sort of torpor and insensibility;
and I looked at Godefroi, and seeing him exceedingly
distressed, I said what I could to encourage him: but he
desired me not to speak. I supposed that it gave offence
to the savages, and therefore was silent; when Pacanne,
king of the Miamis nation, and just out of his minority,
having mounted a horse and crossed the river, rode up to
me. When I heard him calling out to those about me,
and felt his hand behind my neck, I thought he was going
to strangle me out of pity: but he untied me, saying (as
it was afterwards interpreted to me) I give that man his
life. “If you want meat (for they sometimes eat their
prisoners) go to Detroit, or upon the lake (meaning go
face your enemies the English) and you’ll find enough.
What business have you with this man’s flesh, who is
come to speak to us?” I fixed my eyes steadfastly on
this young man, and endeavoured by looks to express my
gratitude. An Indian then presented me his pipe; and I
was dismissed by being pushed rudely away. I made
what haste I could to a canoe, and passed over to the
fort, having received on my way a smart cut of a switch
from an Indian on horseback. Mr. Levi, a Jew trader,
and some soldiers, who were prisoners, came to see me.
Two very handsome young Indian women came likewise,
seemed to compassionate me extremely, and asked
Godefroi a thousand questions. If I remember right,
they were the young king’s sisters. Happy Don Quixote,
attended by princesses! I was never left alone, as the
wretches, who stripped and tied me, were always lurking
about to find an opportunity to stab me. I lay in the
house of one L’Esperance, a Frenchman. The next day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
my Indians spoke on their belts. The two wretches still
sought an opportunity to kill me. The day following the
Miamis returned their answer: “That we must go back;”
shewed the belts of the Senecas, Shawanese, and Delawares;
gave my Indians a small string of white wampum;
and told them: “to go and inform their chiefs of what
they had seen and heard.” While the council sat I was
concealed in L’Esperance’s garret, as Godefroi was
obliged to attend it. Being determined at all events to
get into the Illinois country if possible, St. Vincent and I
agreed, that he should endeavour to gain le Cygne and
the young king to attend me to Wyaut: but, in the middle
of the night, St. Vincent came and awoke me, told me
that two Frenchmen were just arrived from St. Joseph,
and that the Delewares, who were there, were coming
back to the Miamis village. He advised me to send
for my chief immediately, and tell him, for his own
safety as well as mine, to try to get leave to go away in
the morning, (for the Miamis had appointed the next
day but one for our departure). This was accordingly
done, and leave obtained. I went to visit le Cygne, who
told me, “that he would have been glad to have attended
me to Wyaut; but that he could not think of leading me
to my death: for that there were so many tommahawks
lifted up there, that he should have trembled to have
gone himself.” I gave notes to Pacanne and Pondiac’s
nephew, setting forth that they had saved my life, and
entreating all Englishmen to use them kindly. (Pacanne
shewed his paper to Colonel Croghan, when he made his
tour through the Indian country, and the Colonel was
pleased to bring him to Detroit, and, at a private meeting
appointed for that purpose, sent for me, and gave
me a very handsome present to lay at his feet). We gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
all our blankets and shirts to those Indians who had done
us service; and hearing that the chiefs were in council, and
talked of not allowing me to return with my party, but
of detaining me prisoner; and my Indians themselves
appearing uneasy, having left my money and baggage
with one Capucin, a Frenchman, I hurried away about
noon, vexed at heart that I had not been able to execute
the orders I had received. I gave General Bradstreet’s
letter for Monsieur St. Ange, the French commandant at
Fort Chartres, to St. Vincent, to deliver to that officer;
and signed a certificate which he was pleased to put into
my hands, specifying that, on many occasions, he had
saved my life. Fear lent wings to my Indians this day;
and we continued our march till it was quite dark, being
apprehensive of an attack. We set out very early the
next morning; and as nothing worthy of observation
happened, my thoughts were taken up during this day’s
journey in admiring the fine policy of the French with
respect to the Indian nations; of which, from among
a thousand, I shall select two remarkable instances,
which I mention as not only worthy of imitation, but to
wear out of the minds of such of my countrymen as have
good sense and humanity the prejudices conceived
against an innocent, much-abused, and once happy
people; who have as deep a sense of the justice and benevolence
of the French, as of the wrongs and haughty treatment
which they have received from their present masters.
The first of these is the encouragement given by the
French court to marriages betwixt its subjects and
Indian women; by which means Lewis got admission into
their councils, and all their designs were known from
their very birth. Add to this, that the French so entirely
won their affections by this step, that to this hour the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
savages say, that the French and they are one people.
The next instance is, the prohibiting the sale of spirituous
liquors to Indians, under pain of not receiving absolution:
it is what the French call a <i>cas reservé</i>; none but a bishop
can absolve a person guilty of it. This prevented many
mischiefs too frequent among the unfortunate tribes of
savages, who are fallen to our lot. From drunkenness
arise quarrels, murders, and what not? for there is nothing,
however shocking and abominable, that the most
innocent of that innocent people are not madly bent on
when drunk. From imposing on the drunken Indian in
trade, abusing his drunken wife, daughter, or other
female relation, and other such scandalous practices
arise still greater evils. When such things are done
(and they are done) can we wonder that the Indians seek
revenge? The ill conduct of a few dissolute pedlars has
often cost the lives of thousands of his Majesty’s most
industrious subjects, who were just emerging from the
gloom of toil and want, to the fair prospect of ease and
contentment. The following day, while we were shooting
at some turkeys, we discovered the cabins of a hunting
party on the opposite side of the Miamis river; the men
were in the woods; but a squaw came over to us, who
proved to be the wife of the little chief. Godefroi told
her that I was gone to the Ilinois country with her son.
She informed us that the Indians were not returned
from Detroit; and added that there were four hundred
Delawares and three hundred Shawanese (as she had
been told) at the Uttawaw villages, who wanted to go
and set fire to that place. We were sure that this piece
of news about the Shawanese and Delawares was false,
as the Uttawaws themselves wanted provisions: but my
Indians believed it, and it served to bring them over at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
once to my way of thinking, which was, to pass through
the woods, and avoid the villages of the Uttawaws.
They were all much alarmed, but in particular the Huron
of Loretto. This regenerate monster of the church,
this Christian savage,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> who spoke French fluently, had
the cruelty and insolence to tell me, that as I could not
march as fast as the rest, I must take an old man and a
boy (both lame) and make the best of my way: that the
chief would go with me, and he would conduct the other[s],
who were eleven in number, and all able men. I spoke
to him with gentleness, and begged that he would not
think of separating from us; on which he said something,
that I did not understand, in his language which resembles
that of the five nations, and of course was understood
by my chief, and which vexed him so much, that
he told me, “I might go by myself;” but I found means
to pacify him. I now told Godefroi, who was of himself
so determined, that he would of course go with me.
Upon this the Huron gave us very gross language; and
indeed such stubborn impudence I never saw. He told
the chief that if he suffered me to take my horses with me,
we should be discovered, but I obtained the chief’s consent
to take them a little way. I then proposed going
into the wood to settle the distribution of our provisions
and ammunition; but the Huron would listen to nothing:
so leaving him and his party, consisting of ten, with my
best horse, which he said he would turn loose as soon as
he should get a little way further, I struck into the wood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
with Godefroi, the chief, the old Indian, and the Indian
boy; Godefroi and myself on horseback. We went
North East from twelve o’clock till two; from two to
five we went North; and finding a pool of water, we took
up our lodgings there. The next day we continued our
route North, North East, being as nearly as we could
guess in the course of the Miamis river. We endured
great thirst all this day. About three o’clock we reached
the swamps, which, by the dryness of the season, might
have passed for meadows, and not finding any water, about
five o’clock we made a hole, two feet deep, with our hands,
(for we had no kind of tool fit for that use) where some
tall, broad grass grew; and getting good water, though
very muddy, we made a fire, and determined to pass the
night by the side of our little well. We travelled in the
swamps the following day till half an hour after one
o’clock, at which time we came to open woods, having
found water in two places on our way; but we could find
none when we wanted to repose ourselves at the close of
day. We therefore set to work, as the day before, and
made a hole four feet deep in a place which must be a
swamp in the wet season: but it was three hours before we
got a draught of what I might rather call watery mud
than muddy water. We were forced from want of water
to stew a turkey in the fat of a racoon; and I thought
I had never eaten any thing so delicious, though salt was
wanting: but perhaps it was hunger which made me think
so. We heard four shots fired very near us just before
dark; we had a little before discovered the tracks of
Indians, and they undoubtedly had discovered ours, and,
supposing us friends, fired to let us know were they were.
These shots alarmed our chief, and he told me that I
must leave my horses behind. I bid Godefroi drive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
them to some little distance from us, and let them go:
accordingly he went towards the place where we had
left them, as if he intended to do so; but, unknown to me,
wisely deferred it till morning, hoping our chief would
change his mind. This night the chief, seeing me writing
by the light of the fire, grew jealous, and asked if I
was counting the trees. The next morning the chief
being a little intimidated, instead of going East North
East, as agreed on the night before, in order to draw
near the Miamis river, went due North; by which means
he led us into the most perplexed wood I ever saw. He
had my compass, which I asked him for, and wanted to
carry about me, as he very seldom looked at it; but this
gave great offense, and he told me I might go by myself.
In short, he was grown captious beyond measure. In
order to please him, we had put his pack on one of our
horses; but we were forced to take it off again, as a
loaded horse could not force its way through the thick
wood we were in. I found such a difficulty in leading my
horse (for it was impossible to ride) through this part of
the forest, that I called out to the party for God’s sake
to stop till I could see them, or I should never see them
more: at that time I could not be more than fifteen yards
behind them. They had hurried on in pursuit of a
rattle-snake. The chief now told me again, that I must
let my horses go; but Godefroi convinced me, that I could
not reach Detroit without them. I therefore resolved,
if he persisted, to quit him, to take Godefroi with me,
and to kill one of my horses for a supply of food, for we
had very little ammunition left, and no provisions.
However the chief grew good-humoured by Godefroi’s
management; and as he now thought himself out of
danger, changed his course, going East North East. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
soon got into a fine open wood, where there was room
to drive a coach and six. Here we halted to refresh ourselves
by smoaking our pipes, having nothing to eat, the
old Indian, who always ranged as we travelled on, having
found no game that morning. As I had not been used
to smoaking, I desired to have sumach leaves only,
without tobacco; but, after a few whiffs, I was so giddy,
that I was forced to desist: probably an empty stomach
was the chief cause of this unpleasant effect of smoaking.
Soon after we came into extensive meadows; and I was
assured that those meadows continue for a hundred and
fifty miles, being in the winter drowned lands and marshes.
By the dryness of the season they were now beautiful
pastures: and here presented itself one of the most delightful
prospects I ever beheld; all the low grounds being
meadow, and without wood, and all the high grounds
being covered with trees, and appearing like islands;
the whole scene seemed an elysium. Here we found good
water, and sat down by it, and made a comfortable meal
of what the old Indian had killed, after we left our halting-place.
We afterwards continued our route, and at
five o’clock discovering a small rivulet, which gave us all,
and me in particular, inexpressible pleasure, we made a
fire by the side of it, and lay there all night. The day
following, we crossed the tracks of a party of men running
from the Uttawaw villages directly up into the woods, which
we imagined to be those of the Huron’s party who might
have lost their way; as it proved. I laughed and joked
a good deal with Godefroi on this occasion; for when
the Huron left us, I asked in a sneering manner, “if he
had any commands, in case I should get before him to
Detroit;” and he answered me in the same tone, “if when
you arrive, you don’t find me there, you may safely say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
that I am gone to the devil.” Soon after, to our great
joy, we fell into the path leading from the Uttawaw villages
to Detroit, and struck into a by-path to avoid
meeting Indians; but unluckily stumbled on that which
led from the great path to Attawang’s village. We met
three Hurons on horseback, who told us, that peace was
concluded, that the Uttawaws had returned the day
before to their villages, and that General Bradstreet was
to be at Cedar-Point that night on his way to Sandusky.
One of these Indians had been present when I was
prisoner at Attawang’s village; and though I was dressed
like a Canadian, and spoke French to Godefroi to prevent
discovery, recollected me to be the Englishman he had
seen there. I gave him a letter from St. Vincent to
Pondiac which I had promised to deliver. They then
took their leave of us; and as soon as they were out of
sight, we turned into the great path, and putting our
Indians on our horses, Godefroi and I walked at a very
great rate. We arrived at the Pootiwatamy village<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
at a quarter past three, where I had the pleasure of seeing
English colours flying. I wanted to avoid the village;
but the chief, being very hungry (for we had eat nothing
that day) fell into a passion, and asked what we were
afraid of. He knew he ran no risk here. I was a little
vexed, and mounting my horse bid him follow. I went
to the village, where I bought a little Indian corn and a
piece of venison; and then Godefroi and I rode on till
it was dark, in hopes of reaching Detroit the next day;
and finding water, made a fire near it, and passed the
night there, having left our fellow-travellers to sleep with
the Pootiwatamies; who, as none of them knew me, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
told by Godefroi that I was gone to the country of the
Ilinois, and that he growing tired of the journey, and
wanting to see his children, was on his return home.
The next morning we set out at the dawn of day; and,
to save ourselves the trouble of making a raft, took the
upper road, though the journey was much longer that
way, hoping to find the river fordable, in which we were
not disappointed. We travelled this day a great way,
and our horses were so much fatigued, that they were
hardly able to carry us towards the close of the day. We
found fresh horse-dung on the road, which Godefroi having
curiously examined, knew that some Indians had just
passed that way; and by their tracks he was sure they
were before us. He therefore made an excuse to halt
for about an hour, endeavouring to conceal the truth
from me; but I was no stranger to his real motive. However,
about seven o’clock we arrived at Detroit; whence I
was fifty leagues distant when I left the Miamis river and
struck into the woods: and by the circuit I was obliged
to make to avoid pursuit, I made it at least fourscore
leagues, or two hundred and forty miles. The Huron
and his people did not arrive till many days after, and in
three different parties. They had lost their way; were
obliged to divide themselves into small bodies in order to
seek for game; had suffered extremely by fatigue and
hunger; one having died by the way, and all the rest being
very ill when they reached Detroit. The Huron I imagined
would have died. I gave him, as well as all the others,
all the assistance in my power; but could not help reproaching
him with his barbarity to me, and reminding
him, “that the Great Spirit had protected one whom he
had abandoned, and punished him who had basely
deserted his fellow-warrior.” Immediately after my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
arrival at Detroit, I sent an express to General Bradstreet,
with an account of my proceedings, and to warn
him of the dangerous situation he was in, being advanced
some miles up the Sandusky river, and surrounded with
treacherous Indians. The moment he received my
letter, he removed, falling down the river, till he reached
Lake Erie: by this means he disappointed their hopes of
surprising his army. This army however suffered extremely
afterwards, and great numbers were lost in
traversing the desert, many of their boats having in the
night been dashed to pieces against the shore, while the
soldiers were in their tents. The boats were unfortunately
too large to be drawn out of the water. The centinels
gave the alarm on finding the sudden swell of the
lake, but after infinite labour, from the loss of boats, a
large body of men were obliged to attempt to reach Fort
Niagara by land, many of whom perished. It is worthy
of remark, that, during this violent swell of the waters,
soldiers stood on the shore with lighted candles, not a
breath of wind being perceived. This phænomenon
often happens. Another curious fact respecting the waters
of these lakes is, that they rise for seven years and fall
for seven years; or in other words, there is a seven years
tide. I have read somewhere, that the Caspian sea
overflows its banks once in fifteen years. This, however,
is denied elsewhere. But, if the former opinion be
really the case, as the American lakes and the Caspian
sea are in parts of the earth almost opposite to each
other, it might be worth while to enquire, whether, when
they are at the lowest in one place, they are at the highest
in that which is opposite, or both rise and fall at the same
time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>The Natchez nation, mentioned in the letter to Pondiac,
which he shewed me, and who were blamed by the rest of
the Indian army for having fired too soon on the English
who were sent to take possession of Fort Chartres by way
of the Mississippi river, no doubt did it by design, that
the troops might have an opportunity of retreating; for
the French had formerly endeavoured to extirpate that
nation, and had nearly succeeded in the undertaking, a
small number only having escaped the massacre.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It is
not probable such an action could ever be forgiven;
especially by savages. This nation have a perpetual
fire; and two men are appointed to watch it. It has been
conjectured that their ancestors were deserters from the
Mexicans who worship the sun.</p>

<p>The Miamis nation, of whom I have spoken so much,
and into whose hands I fell after leaving Pondiac’s army
at the Uttawaw villages, are the very people who have
lately defeated the Americans in three different battles;
and when the last accounts from that country reached us,
they were encamped on the banks of the Ohio, near the
falls or cataracts of that river.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>It may not be improper to mention, that if I could have
completed the tour intended, viz. from Detroit to New
Orleans, thence to New York, and thence to Detroit
again, whence I set out, it would have been a circuit little
short of five thousand miles.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_294" href="#FNanchor_294" class="label">[4]</a> Jacques Godefroy was a prominent habitant of Detroit, who had been
employed by Major Gladwin to seek an interview with Pontiac on behalf of
the English cause. From this mission he had returned unsuccessful. Later,
dispatched to the Illinois with four other Canadians, they had not only pillaged
an English trader, but aided the Indians to capture Fort Miami. As Godefroy
had taken the oath of allegiance to the British crown in 1760, he was arrested
and sentenced to be hanged on the charge of treason. After this journey with
Morris he continued to live at Detroit, much respected and esteemed, and one
of the richest of the French colony. His son leaned toward the American side
in the Revolution, and assisted George Rogers Clark.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>
